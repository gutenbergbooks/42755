<h1 title="">THE FIREBUG</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><br />CHAPTER I
<br />THE FACE AT THE WINDOW</h2>
<p>It was midnight. The room in which Johnny
Thompson sat was a place of odd noises and
strange flashes of light. Here in the corner a
tick-ticking was followed by a yellow light that
curved upward, over, then down; upward, over
and down again. A gong sounded from overhead.
A shadowy form moved across the floor.
Instantly came the clatter of a score of instruments
sounding as one and a score of yellow
lights curved up, over and down; up, over and
down again. After that a voice said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cross and Fifty-fifth Streets. The Arlington
Flats. The Arlington Flats. Cross and
Fifty-fifth Streets.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>There followed twenty seconds of silence;
then in a hollow tone, as if coming from the
heart of a tree, there sounded the repeated
words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cross and Fifty-fifth Streets. The Arlington
Flats. Cross and Fifty-fifth Streets.&rdquo; Then
again there was silence.</p>
<p>All this while, on a great board above and before
him, Johnny saw a hundred and fifty glowing
spots of light. The spots of light seemed
like eyes&mdash;red, white and green eyes that stared
and blinked at him. Even as he looked, two of
them blinked out&mdash;a red one and a white one.</p>
<p>As he read the meaning of those extinguished
lights he again caught the click-click from the
corner and saw again the yellow light shoot
up and over and down.</p>
<p>This time, however, he heard a voice from
another corner say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny, that&rsquo;s one of yours. School at
Fourteenth and Van Buren.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>With one bound Johnny was out of his chair
and across the room. The next second found
him aboard an elevator, dropping through space.
Ten seconds from the time the alarm had
sounded he was in a long, low built, powerful
car, speeding westward.</p>
<p>It would have been difficult to guess Johnny&rsquo;s
age as he sat erect in the car which the city&rsquo;s
Fire Chief drove like mad. He might have
been in his late teens. His small stature suggested
that. He might have been twenty-two;
his blue fireman&rsquo;s uniform with its brass buttons
would have seemed to prove this. But for
all his uniform Johnny was not a fireman. The
Chief had a very special reason for allowing
him to wear that uniform.</p>
<p>For a week, night and day, Johnny had
haunted the room he had just left. During all
that time the powerful red car had waited below,
parked outside the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>That room of many odd noises and strange
lights was the central fire station of a great
city. Every fire alarm turned in night or day
in this city of three million people came to this
central station. The tickers told of fire-box
calls. The telephone was ever ready for the call
of some woman who had upset her grease can
on the stove, or some person who had discovered
a blaze coming from the sixteenth floor
of a skyscraper. Tens of thousands of calls
a year; yet this untiring ear, listening by day
and night, hears and passes on every one. And
it was in this central station that Johnny had
waited so long. More than a thousand calls
had come ticking and ringing in, yet he had
turned a deaf ear to them all until the man at
the phone had said quietly: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of
yours. School at Fourteenth and Van Buren.&rdquo;
Then he had leaped to his duty. And now he
was speeding westward.</p>
<p>Johnny was after a firebug. A firebug is a
person who willfully sets fire to property,
whether his own or another&rsquo;s. They&rsquo;re a desperate
lot, these firebugs. Some are hired for
a fee. Some work for themselves. All are bad,
for who could be good who would willfully
destroy that which cost men hundreds, perhaps
thousands, of days of toil? Yet some are worse
than others. Some burn for greed or gain,
while others light the torch in the name of some
mistaken idea of principle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>The firebug Johnny had been sent out to catch
certainly had some strange bent to his nature.
Two schools, a recreation center and a bathhouse
had been destroyed, and here was another
school fire at night. And in all these fires the
firebug had neither been seen nor traced.</p>
<p>The police, fire inspectors and insurance detectives
were all on his trail, yet all were baffled.
And now the Fire Chief had called Johnny to
his aid. &ldquo;For,&rdquo; he had said, &ldquo;sometimes a
youngster discovers things which we elders are
blind to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, with their clanging gong waking echoes in
the deserted midnight streets, they sped westward
to Fourteenth, then southward. Before
they had gone two blocks in this direction they
caught the light of the fire against the sky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a bad one,&rdquo; said the Chief,
increasing his speed. &ldquo;In the very heart of the
poorest tenement section&mdash;have to turn in the
second alarm at once. We can&rsquo;t afford to fool
around with this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words were scarcely out of his mouth
when they reached the edge of a throng drawn
there by the fire.</p>
<p>The car came to a sudden stop. The Chief
sprang to a fire-box and instantly in that room
Johnny had so recently left a ticker sounded
and a yellow light rose up and over. The second
alarm had been sent.</p>
<p>Ten seconds later, on the wall of that strange
room, two red spots and two white ones blinked
out, then one that was half red and half white,
and then a green one. At the same instant three
fire engines, three truck and ladder companies
and an emergency squad made the night hideous
with their clanging bells and screaming sirens.
The second alarm had been heard. Reinforcements
were on the way.</p>
<p>Johnny thrilled to it all. It was, he told himself,
like a great battle; only instead of fighting
fellow human beings, men were fighting the
enemy of all&mdash;fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fire! Fire! Fire!&rdquo; rang up and down the
streets.</p>
<p>In Johnny&rsquo;s whirling brain one fact remained
fixed; this fire had been set. By whom? How?
These were the questions he had pledged to
answer.</p>
<p>To Johnny, battle with a fire was always fascinating
and inspiring. He knew well enough
how this one would be waged. The enemy was
within, and must be rushed, beaten back, defeated.
There were three entrances. These
would be stormed with men and water. There
was a great central stairway to the very top of
the six story building. The fire, if freed from
the room in which it had its origin, would go
leaping and laughing up those stairs. The top
of the building must be reached at once. The
poisonous fumes of the fire must be freed there
and its flames beaten back. The roof might be
reached from the fire escape. Already a line of
rubber-coated men were toiling upward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>Ah yes, it was all very fascinating, but Johnny
had his part to do. How had the fire started,
and where? This he must discover if possible.
One more thing; if the fire had been set, was
the firebug still about the place? It is a well
known fact that these men frequently linger
about the scene of the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s here mingling with the throng could
I recognize him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Johnny asked himself this question, he
realized that the answer must almost certainly
be &ldquo;No.&rdquo; And yet there was a chance. An
expression of the face, a movement of muscles,
might give the man away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But first the fire,&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed as,
leaping from the car, he sprang for the already
battered down door of the front entrance.
Gripping a hose that was being slowly dragged
forward by the line of plucky firemen, he
struggled forward with the rest. Beating back
smoke and flames, they battled their way forward
against the red enemy who even now
might be seen leaping madly up the stairs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>Unaccustomed as he was to the smoky fumes,
half suffocated, eyes smarting, Johnny found
himself all but overcome; yet he fought his way
forward.</p>
<p>When the line of firemen halted he battled his
way to the side of the foremost man. To go
farther would be foolhardy. He could but
pause here to study with burning eyes the location
of the fire, to imprint upon the cells of his
brain a mental sketch of the building, then to
back slowly away.</p>
<p>As he staggered blindly into the outer air
he all but fell over a boy who, as boys will, had
escaped the guard and was at the very door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; said Johnny, collaring him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You leave me be,&rdquo; said the boy, struggling
to free himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; said Johnny, tightening his grip,
&ldquo;how did the fire start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d I know?&rdquo; Another yank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did it start?&rdquo; A tighter grip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could see if you had eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; with a shake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the office, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In the office, huh,&rdquo; Johnny loosed his hold a
trifle. &ldquo;Come on back out of the way of the
firemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy obeyed reluctantly. The moment he
was released he darted from sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much, so good,&rdquo; Johnny murmured.
&ldquo;Only thing I can do now is to watch faces;
see if I can spot the man or the woman. Lots
of women firebugs they say, but not on a thing
like this I guess. Takes a man to burn a school,
and such a school, in such a place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as his gaze swept the circle he caught
sight of hundreds of white, frightened faces
peering from windows of rickety tenements&mdash;veritable
tinder boxes waiting the red, hungry
flames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; Johnny muttered, &ldquo;poor as they
are, they are homes, the best these people can
afford. And this is their school, the hope of
their children, the thing that promises to lift
them to better places in the future. Who could
have set a fire like that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>The fire was gaining headway. It burned red
from the fourth floor windows; sent partitions
crashing dismally within and belched forth
great showers of sparks from the roof.</p>
<p>Reinforcements were coming. Bells jangled,
hose uncoiled on the hot pavement; a water
screen from a dozen nozzles poured upon the
steaming homes to the lee of the fire.</p>
<p>And all this time Johnny Thompson wandered
back and forth in front of the line of staring
and frightened men, women and children held
back by a rope line hastily established by the
police.</p>
<p>When his eyes were tired and he had told
himself there was no hope of finding his man, he
drifted wearily back through the line and into
a small shop that stood open. There on the top
of a barrel he sat down to think.</p>
<p>For a moment or two he was entirely unconscious
of the other occupants of the room.
When at last he cast a glance about him it was
to give a great start that all but threw him from
his seat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>Before him, staring out of the window at the
fire, was one of the most peculiar men he had
ever seen. An albino, men would have called
him, yet of unmistakable white blood. His hair
was white and soft as a baby&rsquo;s. His face was
quite innocent of beard and, what startled
Johnny most, the eyes of the man were pink
as a white rabbit&rsquo;s. To accurately judge the
age of such a man was impossible. Johnny
told himself that the man might be twenty-five
or he might be forty.</p>
<p>Most astonishing of all was the expression on
the man&rsquo;s face. Johnny had seen just such an
expression on the face of a boy when he had
done something he thought of as extraordinarily
clever. Even as Johnny looked at him the expression
changed to one of fear and dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; the man exclaimed. &ldquo;A child!
There at the window on the sixth floor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true. At a window, staring wild-eyed
at the throng below her, was a girl of some
twelve years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A child in the school house at midnight, and
on the attic floor!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed. &ldquo;What
can it mean?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>The next instant his mind was on fire. Two
thoughts fought for occupation of his brain.
The child must be saved. All escape from
within was shut off by flames; yet she must be
saved; yes, she must be saved, and after that
she must be questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;that she knows
something regarding the origin of the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this he was not entirely wrong.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><br />CHAPTER II
<br />A THRILLING RESCUE</h2>
<p>It was a dramatic moment, such a moment as
comes at times to the lives of firemen. Had the
building been a tenement it would have been
searched from cellar to garret; had it even been
a business block, little less than this would have
been done. But a school house! Who would
have suspected it of housing a child at midnight?</p>
<p>Others in the throng had seen the child and
now great shouts came up from the crowd that
surged the line.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>Coolly, methodically, as is the manner of
those whose business it is to save lives, the firemen
backed a ladder truck into position. After
a speedy measurement with his eye, the Chief
marked a spot sixteen feet from the building,
and there the base of the ladder came to rest.
Then, up, up, up, as if by magic, the ladder ascended
in air. Not touching the building, but
ever mounting, it reached the level of the third
floor, the fourth floor, the fifth. A mighty
shout arose when it came to the level of the
window where the child, leaning far out, waved
her slender arms in mute petition.</p>
<p>As yet the ladder was far out beyond her
reach. A fireman must climb the ladder to bring
her down. Johnny Thompson was no player to
the grandstand, but a sudden thought had
struck him and the next second had set him into
action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I go up&mdash;if I save her,&rdquo; he thought to
himself as he dashed for the ladder, &ldquo;she will
think of me as her friend. She&rsquo;ll tell me all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; he exclaimed, reaching out a hand
for the truck as the Chief was about to detail
a man, &ldquo;Let me go up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>Had the Chief not known Johnny so well;
had he not realized that the boy had lived all
his life in such a manner as would fit himself
for a moment like this; lived clean, grasped
every opportunity for practice that makes a
fellow active and physically fit, he would have
pushed him aside&mdash;this was no moment for
playing. But now, knowing Johnny as he did,
he only rumbled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment, agile as a monkey ascending
the side of his cage, Johnny was leaping upward.</p>
<p>Through his mind, as he climbed, passed
many shadowy questions. Was the ladder set
right? Would it fall to position, or would it
buckle to send him crashing to the pavement?
Such a thing had happened; might happen now.
Still he climbed. The slender reed-like ladder
swayed as he climbed.</p>
<p>One story was passed, another, another, and
yet another. Who was this girl? How had she
come to be on the top floor of the school at such
a time? Had she set the fire and then, frightened
at her deed, fled to a place of hiding?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>The ladder swayed more and more. Then,
just as he reached the level of the fifth floor it
swung slowly in and came to rest against the
sixth floor window ledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Ah!&rdquo; Johnny sighed.</p>
<p>Less than a moment after that, with one
arm about the child&rsquo;s slender waist and with her
arms about his neck, he found himself descending.
Far below the crowd was shouting mad
approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, little girl,&rdquo; he said, talking in the
girl&rsquo;s ear that he might be heard above the
hubub of the street, &ldquo;where do you live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child started, then stared up at the burning
schoolhouse as if to say: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What she said was: &ldquo;Not anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No home?&rdquo; Johnny said in astonishment.</p>
<p>The girl nodded.</p>
<p>Johnny was nonplussed. Here was a new
mystery, and there was no time to solve it. At
last he was at the base of the ladder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Tom,&rdquo; he said to a stalwart fireman
who sat at the wheel of the truck, &ldquo;take care
of this child. Don&rsquo;t let her get out of your
sight. She may be a valuable witness. I&rsquo;ll be
back soon. I want to look for&mdash;for a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dropped to the street where glowing and
sputtering bits of wood floated on rivers of
water.</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s attention was instantly caught by
a strange creature that rested on the fireman&rsquo;s
shoulder&mdash;a large monkey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Jerry,&rdquo; smiled Tom. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s our
mascot. Came to us of his own free will. Tenement
burned on the near west side. After everybody
was out an&rsquo; the walls was totterin&rsquo; Jerry
comes scamperin&rsquo; down a drain pipe, hopped on
my shoulder, and he&rsquo;s been there lot of times
since. Nobody&rsquo;s ever claimed him. He&rsquo;s been
with us three years, so I guess nobody ever
will claim him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sensing that the conversation was about him,
the monkey evidently decided to show off a bit.
Leaping from Tom&rsquo;s shoulder, he made the
towering ladder at a bound and was half way
up before the child could let out her first scream
of delight. Then, as the ladder began to double
in upon itself, he raced down again, to at last
make one mighty leap and land squarely in the
girl&rsquo;s lap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>In the meantime Johnny was fighting his way
through the throng toward the store where he
had seen the pink-eyed man.</p>
<p>The crowd was increasing. He made his way
through it with great difficulty. Then, just as
he reached the outer edge of it, there came a
cry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back! Back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wedged in between a fat Jewish woman
with a shawl over her head and a dark Italian
with a bundle on his back, Johnny found himself
carried backward, still backward, then to
one side until a passage had been made.</p>
<p>Through this passage, like a young queen in
a pageant, the girl he had rescued rode atop the
truck. And by her side, important as a footman,
rode Jerry, the monkey.</p>
<p>Hardly had the truck moved to a place of
safety than again came the cry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back! Back!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>Once more the crowd surged away from the
fire. High time it was, too, for the brick walls,
trembling like a tree before its fall, threatened
to topple over and crush them.</p>
<p>For a long moment it stood tottering, then
instead of pitching headlong into the street, it
crumbled down like a melting mass of waxen
blocks.</p>
<p>A wail rose from the crowd. Their school
was gone. This was followed almost at once
by a shout of joy. Their homes were saved, for
were not a score of nozzles playing upon the
crumbled, red-hot mass, reducing it to blackness
and ashes?</p>
<p>Such was the burning of the Shelby School.
Who had set this fire? Where was he now?
These were Johnny Thompson&rsquo;s problems. Unless
they were speedily solved there was reason
to believe that within a month, perhaps within
a week, or even a day, other public buildings
would be burned to a heap of smouldering ruins.
Who was this firebug? What could his motives
be?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>He thought of the pink-eyed man and of that
expression he had surprised on his face. He
fought his way back to the store in which he had
seen the man. The store was dark, the door
locked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use;&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t find him
in this crowd. Probably never see him again.
Probably nothing to it, anyway. Some people
are so constituted that they just naturally enjoy
a catastrophe. They&rsquo;d smile at the burning of
their own home. Nero fiddled while Rome
burned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this he was partly wrong. He was destined
to see this pink-eyed man again, again, and yet
again; and always under the most unusual circumstances.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>But now his thoughts turned to the child. She
had said she had no home. How could that be?
What did she know about the fire? Had she
been in the building at the time it was set?
That seemed probable. Could she answer important
questions? That seemed probable, too.
He must question her; not now, not here, but in
some quiet place. She needed rest and probably
food as well. Where should he take her? He
had no relatives in the city. His own room
would not do. The fire station would be too
public and the little girl would be too greatly
alarmed to talk well there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mazie,&rdquo; he thought to himself, &ldquo;Mazie will
take us in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, he and the girl were speeding
toward the home of Mazie, the girl pal of
Johnny&rsquo;s boyhood days.</p>
<p>It was a very much surprised Mazie who at
last answered Johnny&rsquo;s repeated ringing of her
bell, but when she saw it was Johnny who called
she at once invited him to join her in the
kitchen, the proper place to entertain a friend
who calls at three in the morning in a grimy
fireman&rsquo;s uniform.</p>
<p>Mazie was a plump young lady. The bloom
on her cheeks was as natural as the brown of
her abundant hair. A sincere, honest, healthy
girl she was&mdash;just the kind to be pal to a boy
like Johnny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mazie,&rdquo; said Johnny as he entered the
kitchen and sat down to watch her light the gas,
&ldquo;this is a little girl I found. I have a notion
she&rsquo;s hungry&mdash;are you?&rdquo; he turned to the girl.</p>
<p>The girl nodded her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tillie McFadden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a strange story that Tillie McFadden
told over Mazie&rsquo;s cold lunch and steaming cocoa.
She truly had no home. Weeks before&mdash;she
did not now how many&mdash;her mother had died.
Neighbors had come in. They had talked of
an orphan asylum for her. She had not known
quite what that was, but it had frightened her.
She ran away. A corner newstand man had
allowed her to sell papers for him. With these
few pennies she had bought food. For three
nights she had slept on a bed of shavings in a
barrel back of a crockery store.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>Then, while prowling round a school house at
night, she had discovered a basement window
with a broken catch. She had climbed in and,
having made her way to the upper story which
was used as a gymnasium, had slept on wrestling
mats. Since this was better than the barrel,
like some stray kitten that has found its
way out of the dark and the cold, she had made
her home there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she exclaimed, her eyes growing
suddenly wide with excitement, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all burned
up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time did you go to sleep to-night?&rdquo;
Johnny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I think I heard the tower clock strike
eleven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And were you up there all the time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, down in the office mostly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The office?&rdquo; Johnny leaned forward eagerly.
That was where the fire had started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you doing in the office?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looking at picture books. Lots of them
down there, and I could read by the light
from the street lamp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t you hear any sound; smell smoke
or anything?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;o,&rdquo; the girl cast upon him a look of
puzzled eagerness. It was plain that she wished
to help all she could.</p>
<p>Further questioning revealed the fact that she
had nothing more of importance to tell. The
sound of fire gongs and sirens had wakened her.
She had gone to the window to look down.
Then, realizing her peril, she had dashed for
the head of the stairs, only to find her way cut
off by flames and smoke. She had returned to
the window. The rest Johnny knew as well
as she.</p>
<p>After the child had been put to sleep on a
couch in the living room, Johnny and Mazie
sat long by the kitchen table, talking. Johnny
told of his new task and of his hopes of capturing
the firebug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the police and fire
inspectors are working on it. They&rsquo;ll probably
solve the mystery first. I hope they solve it
to-morrow. No one wants the city&rsquo;s buildings
burned and lives endangered by fire. But,&rdquo;
he sighed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to be the lucky fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you might,&rdquo; said Mazie loyally. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
wish I could help you. Oh, Johnny, can&rsquo;t I?
Couldn&rsquo;t I come down and stay awhile in that
strange central station where all the alarms
come in? It must be fairly bewitching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess there&rsquo;d be no objection to that,&rdquo;
said Johnny thoughtfully. &ldquo;As for your helping
me, I&rsquo;ll welcome all the help I can get. Looks
like I was going to need it. Didn&rsquo;t get a clue
except&mdash;well, there was the pink-eyed man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pink-eyed man?&rdquo; Mazie exclaimed in
amazement. &ldquo;Who was he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny told her about the man in the store.
&ldquo;Probably not much to it,&rdquo; he added at the
end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Johnny,&rdquo; said Mazie suddenly, &ldquo;if
Tillie was in the office until nearly eleven o&rsquo;clock,
how could the fire, which started near the office,
have gotten going so strong before the firemen
arrived? It takes some time to start a big
blaze, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it must,&rdquo; answered Johnny thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t seem that the firebug could
have accomplished it in an hour. It might have
been&mdash;&rdquo; he paused to consider&mdash;&ldquo;it might
have been set by a mechanism such as is sometimes
used on a time bomb, but how could it
have been gotten in during the day? Tell you
what!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go back there as soon
as the fire cools and look about in the ruins.
That side of the wall fell outward. If a
mechanism was used, its remains should still
be there. I may discover something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did go and he did discover something. At
the time of this discovery the thing appeared
insignificant, but Johnny&rsquo;s motto was, &ldquo;You
never can tell,&rdquo; and so he filed it away in his
memory.</p>
<p>Mazie did go down to the central alarm station
on the very next night, and that night there
came in over the wires the thrilling third alarm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><br />CHAPTER III
<br />THE FALSE ALARM</h2>
<p>After receiving Mazie&rsquo;s assurance that the
little waif of the schoolhouse would be properly
cared for, Johnny went at once to his own
room, where he caught ten winks before the
sun was high.</p>
<p>After a hasty breakfast, he returned to the
scene of the fire. He found heaps of charcoal
and broken timbers smouldering beneath piles
of brick, but fortune favored his search. The
section of basement that had been directly beneath
the office was entirely free from fire and
bricks. He was soon busily poking round in
the ashes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mechanism&rdquo;; he thought to himself, &ldquo;a
thing of wheels and a spring like an alarm
clock is what I&rsquo;m looking for&mdash;a thing that
runs just so long, then starts something.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But not necessarily so complicated,&rdquo; he
thought a moment later as he recalled the story
of a firebug who, having soaked a common
wooden mouse trap with kerosene, had baited
it carefully and had so attached a match to the
spring of the trap that when a mouse sprang
it the match would light. He had then set
the trap at the bottom of a huge waste paper
basket into which the papers and scraps from
noon hour lunch boxes had been cast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simple, but possibly effective,&rdquo; he said to
himself. Then, almost humorously, he began
keeping an eye out for the heat reddened wires
of a mouse trap.</p>
<p>Not even these rewarded his search. Only
the things common to a school office were to
be found. Pencil ends, the remains of a pencil
sharpener, metal backs to loose-leaf blank books,
the charred remains of a telephone, blackened
electric light fixtures and wires, wires, wires
running everywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing to be learned here,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>Picking up the metal base of the telephone,
he examined it idly. Then of a sudden he
looked at it with a keen interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;two sets of
wires running from it, one heavier than the
other. Wonder what that could mean. Trace
&rsquo;em out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did trace them out. He found that one
pair, as the usual wires always do, led to a
small pipe outside the wall. The other pair,
fine and short, not more than fifteen feet long,
ended in nothing at all&mdash;just broke off
abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s queer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so queer after all, perhaps,&rdquo; he added
after a moment&rsquo;s thought. &ldquo;Most likely ran
to a bell jack in another room. Then if the
clerk or principal were working in that room
and the phone rang, the bells would repeat the
call. Nothing simpler than that. Nothing to
it, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But where&rsquo;s the jack,&rdquo; he thought again.
&ldquo;The box would burn, but there are fine coils
on a spool inside. They wouldn&rsquo;t burn; neither
would the bells.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A careful search brought no reward. If
there had been a bell jack the metal parts had
vanished. This puzzled Johnny but he placed
little importance on the circumstance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t mean anything,&rdquo; he muttered as
he lifted himself up from the basement. &ldquo;Just
have to check this fire off as a complete loss,
unless the discovery of that pink-eyed man
means something. I may see him sometime.
And then, of course, what Tillie McFadden
told me about being in the office almost up to
the time of the fire seems to show that the fire
was arranged for in advance. But how?
That&rsquo;s the question. All I&rsquo;ve got to say is,
this firebug is no ordinary rascal. He&rsquo;s a man
of keen mind. He&rsquo;ll be hard to catch.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>He took the car downtown. It was his intention
to go to the central station and report
to Chief McQueen, but as he was about to
change cars he chanced to notice a head and
a pair of shoulders ahead of him that looked
familiar. At that moment the man turned
his head. Johnny saw his eyes. They were
pink. Somewhat unsteadily he dropped back
in his seat.</p>
<p>His thoughts raced. The man was his pink-eyed
stranger of the night before. What should
he do? Call a policeman? This thought was
instantly abandoned. A man could scarcely be
arrested for the look on his face, and that was
really all he had seen amiss in the man. Follow
him? If possible, learn something of his
haunts? That was better. He&rsquo;d do that.</p>
<p>Scarcely had he settled back comfortably in
his seat than the man pressed the button, then
rose to get off. Johnny followed.</p>
<p>Once off the car the man struck directly
across the street, walked a half block, then
turned to the right. He was now at the river.
He went down a narrow, dirty sort of boat
landing that skirted the river. Johnny could
not follow here without being noticed, so, walking
out on the bridge, he kept a watch from
the corner of his eye.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>About a block from the street the man turned
again, this time to vanish. He had entered a
door.</p>
<p>After carefully counting first the windows,
then the doors in that block, then noting the
type of building the man had entered, Johnny
left the bridge to follow the street. Then,
after turning the corner, he came up to the
front of the building the man had entered.</p>
<p>Before that building he paused. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
it,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Funny sort of place to be
going into.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The place did seem strange. It was a store
front, but the room on the street had not been
used for months. The dust was so thick on
the windows that one could discern objects
within only as through a fog. The doorway
was littered with heaps of dirty bits of paper
deposited there by the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been a commission merchant&rsquo;s place sometime,&rdquo;
was Johnny&rsquo;s mental comment as he
caught a glimpse of dust blackened banana
crates within. &ldquo;Ships brought in produce and
landed it at the back. Business didn&rsquo;t thrive.
Too far east on this street.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;guess that&rsquo;s about all
for this time. Won&rsquo;t forget the place, though,
nor Mister Pink-Eyes either,&rdquo; and with that
he turned and headed for the central fire
station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; said the Chief as they sat in
his office that afternoon, &ldquo;I hope you realize
the importance of the work you are attempting
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so too,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a detective, Johnny. Your work
is more that of an inspector. An inspector looks
into the cause of fires and tries to prevent them.
Man&rsquo;s best friend, and worst enemy, is fire.
It&rsquo;s a case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. The Mr.
Hyde side of fire is a heartless brute. We are
constantly attempting to destroy that side of
his nature. All men should be enlisted on our
side. Unfortunately, all are not. Those who
go over to the enemy must be treated as enemies.
They must be captured and imprisoned.
There are times when I think the worst of
them should be shot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the loss of property that&rsquo;s the
worst of it, but the loss of human life. And
life, Johnny,&rdquo; the inspector laid a hand on
Johnny&rsquo;s knee, &ldquo;human life is the most precious
thing in the world, and any man who has the
slightest disregard for the &lsquo;least of these&rsquo;
isn&rsquo;t fit to live. It would be better that a stone
be tied about his neck and that he be cast
into the midst of the sea. That&rsquo;s what the
Good Book says, Johnny, and it&rsquo;s true, almighty
true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming up to the central alarm to-night?&rdquo;
he asked after a moment&rsquo;s silence.</p>
<p>Johnny nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to bring a friend,&rdquo; said Johnny,
easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A girl pal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girl?&rdquo; The chief frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till you know her,&rdquo; grinned Johnny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>Eleven o&rsquo;clock that night found Johnny and
Mazie in the place of the central alarm. The
Chief was there too and was as much pleased
with Johnny&rsquo;s choice of a pal as he might have
been had Mazie been his own daughter.</p>
<p>As for Mazie, she was thrilled to the tips of
her fingers by this place of ticking instruments,
clanging gongs and leaping light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See those red, white and green spots of
light up there?&rdquo; said the Chief. &ldquo;Well, those
are located on the map of the city. They stand
for fire stations. Red is for a fire engine,
white for a hook and ladder company. If a
spot is half red and half white it means that
the station houses two companies, one engine
and one hook and ladder. Green is for an
emergency squad. When a fire alarm is sent
in we know that certain companies will go out,
say 12, 18 and 30. By moving plugs I darken
their lights. We can tell by a glance at the
map just how our forces stand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fighting fires,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;is just like directing
forces in a war. It chances that I am
commander-in-chief. I arrange my forces just
as a great army commander does. If an alarm
comes in, say from the stock yards, four companies,
5, 13, 23 and 40 go out at once. Their
absence leaves a dark spot on the map.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It proves to be a bad fire. The marshal
sends in the second alarm. At once companies
7, 41, 63 and 70 go out. A broader spot is
darkened. I am beginning to think of reinforcements.
The fire spreads. The third alarm.
Companies 16, 29, 86 and 94 go out. More
darkness on the map. Time for reinforcements,
for, should a new fire break out in that area,
there would be no one to respond. At once
I send out an order for 103, 109, 31 and 42
to move up to the positions previously occupied
by 16, 29, 86, and 94.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I tell you,&rdquo; he enthused, &ldquo;it is a wonderful
war; not against one&rsquo;s fellow, but a war
against one of the manifestations of nature.
It&rsquo;s a clean fight, with no one&rsquo;s blood on your
hands when the battle&rsquo;s won.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The pity is,&rdquo; his voice dropped to a low
rumble, &ldquo;that some of our fellow men go over
from time to time to join the enemy. It&rsquo;s a
shame and a disgrace. It&rsquo;s such traitors as
these that are keeping Johnny and me awake
nights now, as you know all too well,&rdquo; he said
turning to Mazie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; exclaimed the girl.</p>
<p>A yellow light had leaped up, over and down,
up, over and down. An instrument had begun
to chatter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first alarm; close in,&rdquo; said the Chief.
&ldquo;May be serious; may be only a false alarm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barney &amp; Kuhl warehouse, 18th and Michigan,&rdquo;
the operator droned into the receiver,
&ldquo;18th and Michigan, the Barney &amp; Kuhl warehouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later, like an echo, his message
came back to him through the megaphone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a big place. May be serious. I
hope not, though. I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chief&rsquo;s speech was checked by the stutter
of an instrument.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>Leaping toward the instrument he seized the
narrow white tape which, moving out from the
instrument, was marked with red dots and
dashes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The second alarm,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Looks
bad. Marshal Neil signs. He&rsquo;s one of our
best. Companies 1, 17, 42, 71 and 98 go out
on the call. That makes ten companies in all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leaves a rather large area unprotected.&rdquo;
His brow wrinkled as he studied the broad dark
spot on the map.</p>
<p>For a moment he stood there as if in deep
thought. Then, to the operator:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finley, call 3, 10, 14, 21 and 104 to the
positions of the companies just called out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly there came the flash of a light, the
clatter of instruments, and the thing was done.
Well done, too, for a moment later, into the
startled silence of the room, came the clatter of
the third alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The third alarm. Five more companies. I
must go!&rdquo; exclaimed the Chief. &ldquo;Will you
go, Johnny? It may be your chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mazie?&rdquo; asked Johnny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Crowd her in,&rdquo; grumbled the Chief.</p>
<p>A moment later they were speeding southward.</p>
<p>Down deserted streets they sped, past groups
of night prowlers, round corners, by slow-moving
milk wagons, their gong ever clearing
the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange,&rdquo; murmured the Chief, straining
his eyes ahead. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see much smoke. No
blaze. No blaze. Mighty queer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then as they whirled around a corner the
whole truth came to him in a flash. He had
been tricked. Three alarms had been turned
in; three, and every one of them a <i>false alarm</i>!
The perpetrator knew what Marshal Neil signed.
He knew the call. Before them, lined up for
three blocks, was a red row of fire fighting
trucks, but no fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a plot,&rdquo; the Chief muttered through
tight set teeth. &ldquo;I wonder what it means?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>He had not long to wait, for the answer came
quickly. This broad area had been cleared of
fire fighting equipment that a clean break might
be given to another blaze that had been set.
Certainly this must be true, for even as they
stood there wondering they heard the distant
siren of a fire engine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the reserves I called up!&rdquo; the chief exclaimed.
&ldquo;Thank God for them. They have
answered the alarm of the real fire. Soon we
will all be on our way. Straight ahead!&rdquo; he
exclaimed to his driver.</p>
<p>The car shot ahead and in less than a moment
they were amongst the throng of bewildered fire
fighters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a real fire and a bad one,&rdquo; said the
Chief two minutes later as they came for the
first time that night in sight of a furnace-like
glow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><br />CHAPTER IV
<br />JERRY TO THE RESCUE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; exclaimed the Chief, turning to
Johnny, &ldquo;is one of yours. It&rsquo;s the old Garrity
School.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Johnny answered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not
a school now; sort of a social center for downtown
folks. The fire starts in the office as
usual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure enough it does. You&rsquo;re a wizard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need to be a wizard to tell that. This
is the fourth fire on city property and every
one started near the office. Time we were learning
something from that one fact, something
about how the fires are set. I dug up a bit of
evidence in that last fire; couple of wires
in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t learn much about this fire until
it&rsquo;s burned out,&rdquo; broke in the Chief. &ldquo;Look
at her shooting toward the sky. That dirty
trick they played us lost us time.&rdquo; He leaped
from the car and was at once in the midst of
it, quietly issuing orders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to be bad,&rdquo; he said to Marshal Neil.
&ldquo;If we save the Simons Building we&rsquo;ll be in
luck. Wind&rsquo;s strong from the lake. It&rsquo;s fireproof,
but has no shutters. Full of furniture,
new furniture. Burn like stove wood. Get all
the lines you can spare playing on that side.
Beat it back if you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corigon,&rdquo; he turned suddenly to the driver,
&ldquo;go send in another alarm. Call up the fire
boat. She&rsquo;s got twelve lines. It&rsquo;s pretty far to
the river, but she&rsquo;ll do in an emergency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neil, tell the boys to get up the fire tower.
Clear the Simons Building. Not many people in
there, I guess. Some cleaners, though. Better
be safe. She&rsquo;ll go fast if she goes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>There <i>were</i> people in the Simons Building;
three at least&mdash;Johnny, Mazie and the pink-eyed
man whom Johnny suspected of being the
firebug. Johnny and Mazie had left the car
and had been skirting the engines for a better
look at the fire when Johnny had suddenly
brought Mazie up with a shrill whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fire&mdash;the&mdash;the pink-eyed man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There. He&rsquo;s just crossing the street. I
believe&mdash;yes, yes. C&rsquo;mon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In imminent danger of being run down by a
fire engine, they darted across the street and
into the Simons Building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wait here in the corridor,&rdquo; whispered
Johnny. &ldquo;He went in. I saw him. Want to
shadow him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I might lose you. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll go along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On tiptoes they explored the corridors. Then,
having found no sign of the man, and having
come upon an unlocked stairway door, they
started up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>There were no open doors at the second,
third or fourth floors, nor at the fifth, nor
sixth. Johnny had about decided to turn back
when he discovered the seventh floor door stood
ajar.</p>
<p>Tip-toeing silently forward, they entered the
corridor, a long tunnel-like affair extending as
far as they could see, both to the right and left,
and lighted only by some small red lamps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down this way. I heard him,&rdquo; Mazie whispered.</p>
<p>At that identical instant Johnny actually
caught sight of a movement in the opposite
direction. Without thinking that his companion
would do other than follow, he tip-toed down
the corridor.</p>
<p>The person, whoever he was, moved silently
down the hall to at last suddenly disappear
through a door or a side hall to the left.
Stealthily Johnny followed on. As for Mazie,
being actually confident of her discovery of the
person and supposing as a matter of course
that Johnny would follow her, she had gone
tip-toeing in the opposite direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>She had not gone a dozen paces when, on
hearing a sound at her left, she found herself
looking down a corridor darker than the first
and which ran off at right angles to the one she
was following.</p>
<p>By this time she had discovered that Johnny
had vanished; but lured on by slight sounds and
spurred forward by the tang of adventure, she
followed on down this corridor, then turned into
another one to the right, and after that a great
way to the left again. When at last she came
up square against a door at the end of this
last corridor and found that there was no right
nor left for her now, she began dimly to sense
the fact that she was lost.</p>
<p>She did not realize this in all its fullness
until she had started to retrace her steps. Then,
to her consternation, she discovered three corridors
running to the right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three,&rdquo; she whispered as her heart skipped
a beat, &ldquo;and which one was it that I came
down?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>At that precise moment a fresh suggestion
of horror set her knees trembling. Her delicate
nostrils had detected smoke! There could be
no doubt about it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fire&rsquo;s just across the street,&rdquo; she thought,
&ldquo;and the wind is right this way. This building
may be on fire at this very moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her only thought now was of escape. But
what was the way out?</p>
<p>She thought of the door at the end of the
hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably opens on a stair,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>It did, but the stair went up, not down. By
this time, quite thoroughly frightened, she took
the up-going stairs. She had climbed three
flights before she realized her folly. At that
time she found herself at a door leading down
the corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow it to a stairway that is open all the
way down,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>She had gone a hundred feet or more when
light from a room attracted her attention.</p>
<p>There was, she found, no lamps lit in the
room. The light entered through the window&mdash;the
glow of the fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>Impulsively she rushed to the window and
threw up the sash. The sight that struck her
eye staggered her like a blow upon the head.
Dizzy depths below was the street where the
struggling firemen toiled, and half way up to
where she stood, and off a hundred or more
feet to the right, her own building was belching
forth flames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how am I ever to escape!&rdquo; she
breathed as she dropped limply by the window
sill.</p>
<p class="tb">All this time Johnny Thompson had not
been idle. The clue he followed had led him
at last to a room that was open, and in that
room he had found, not the man of the pink
eyes, but an Italian cleaner waxing the floor.
He at once warned the man to leave the
building.</p>
<p>Chagrined at his failure to locate his man,
he turned about to look for Mazie. Then, for
the first time, he knew they were separated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>Realizing the danger of remaining in this
building too long, he hastened back over his
trail. Having come to the place where they
had been separated, he made his way first to
the right, then to the left. Calling her name,
but receiving no reply, he wandered back and
forth for some time. Then, catching the first
faint sign of smoke, he hurried back to the head
of the stairway and fairly flew down it. He
was going for aid. A number of searchers
might find her where one would fail.</p>
<p>Into the street, thronged now with firemen,
laced and interlaced by lines of hose, soaked
and slippery with water, for some time he
found no one whom he could feel sure was in
charge of men. At last he came upon Marshal
Neil. The Marshal was kindly, but inflexible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men have been sent to warn workers out
of the building,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Doubtless they will
come upon the girl and bring her down. No
others can be spared.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>Sick at heart, Johnny was about to retrace his
steps and again enter the building when an
exclamation from the man nearest him attracted
his attention. The man was not a fireman.
Johnny recognized him instantly as the cause of
all his present trouble. It was the pink-eyed
man. But, having followed the man&rsquo;s upward
glance, he saw that which drove all other
thoughts out of his mind. There, in the tenth
story window, waving her arms frantically, was
Mazie.</p>
<p>What had happened? Simply this: As calmly
as her wildly throbbing brain would permit her,
Mazie had made her way down every corridor
that suggested a possible exit. She had found
only two. These two were blocked by smoke
and fire. Her only hope of escape lay through
that window; a window that was far above the
reach of the tallest ladder.</p>
<p>Johnny was struck dumb. How was she to
be saved?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not send the monkey up?&rdquo; calmly suggested
the pink-eyed man.</p>
<p>Johnny stared at him blankly. What could
the man mean? He must be a madman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>As Johnny thought of this the man began
dragging a large ball of strong hempen twine
from his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send him up with the end of this,&rdquo; he said,
as calmly as if he had been suggesting tying
a parcel with it. At the same time he gave a
sidewise nod toward Jerry, the monkey mascot
of the hook and ladder company.</p>
<p>Instantly Johnny was at the side of the truck.
Here was a chance, though a slim one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Jerry ever scale a wall?&rdquo; he asked of
the driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many&rsquo;s the time. Guess he must&rsquo;a belonged
to an organ grinder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would he take the end of this to her?&rdquo;
asked Johnny, looking up at the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebby. Then what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d attach the lower end to a rope from
the emergency wagon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d draw up the rope, attach it to something
inside the room, and come on down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hand over hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a girl!&rdquo; Johnny shouted fiercely.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a girl, but not the soft kind. She&rsquo;s got
nerve, Mazie has. And when she was a kid
she could climb a rope. I know. She was my
pal. She&rsquo;s not forgotten how. Question is, are
you going to send Jerry up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The driver climbed down from his wagon
with alacrity, then working his way through the
scorching heat to a place beneath the window,
he looked up to the window where the girl was
plainly visible, patted Jerry on the head, and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;See her up there? It&rsquo;s roasted chestnuts and
a box of chocolates fer you if you get up
to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With almost human intelligence the little
creature took the cord firmly in his teeth and
with a leap was away, scurrying up from window
ledge to window ledge, making progress
where even a squirrel would not have attempted
to go.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>Mazie, on her part, could not so much as
guess what was going on below. She was
trapped. They knew that. They would save
her if it was humanly possible. She knew that,
too. She had caught the bright gleam of the
monkey&rsquo;s cap as he was carried to the wall,
but what could the monkey have to do with
her rescue?</p>
<p>Strangely enough, in this moment of excitement
and great danger, she felt a desire to sing.
It often happens that way. And the songs that
came to her mind were songs of peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a sweet peace that is calm as a river,&rdquo;
she sang softly.</p>
<p>And then:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I tell Him all that troubles me,</p>
<p class="t">I tell Him what amays;</p>
<p class="t0">And so we walk together,</p>
<p class="t">My&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>Her song broke short off. Had she seen a
vision? No, there it was again, Jerry&rsquo;s jaunty
red cap bobbing down there above a window,
half way between her own window and the
ground.</p>
<p>It was strange what a comfort she found in
the company of such a small creature, for he
truly was company. Was he not much closer to
her than any other living thing? Even as she
watched, the monkey drew nearer, leaping from
ledge to ledge, climbing higher and higher.</p>
<p>Without in the least understanding what it
all meant, Mazie found her heart in her mouth
as the dauntless little creature, leaping from a
window sill, caught a stone ledge with but one
hand, balanced there for a second as if about
to fall, and then threw himself with a fine show
of skill to another and wider ledge where he
might pause an instant for breath.</p>
<p>An instant only, then he was at it again,
climbing, climbing. Clawing here, leaping there,
swinging to a window, up&mdash;up&mdash;up, until at
last, with a sigh of relief, the girl seized him
and dragged him in.</p>
<p>The instant she saw the end of the string
she understood and hope came ebbing back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>Not a second was to be lost. The fire, which
was working toward the center of the building
and up, was now only four windows to the right
and five down. Had the building not been fireproof
it would have burned like a torch. As it
was, the fire, fed by the contents of offices and
store-rooms, worked its way from room to room.</p>
<p>Rapidly she drew in the cord, and with it the
rope attached to the end. When at last she held
the end of the rope in her hand she carried it to
a heavy table and wrapped it about the top.
Then she dragged the table to the window.</p>
<p>At once the monkey, as if to show her the
way, went scampering down the rope.</p>
<p>All this had taken time. When at last the
girl, with a little prayer for protection on her
lips, gripped the rope firmly and glanced down,
she saw that fire had burst forth from the window
two rows to her right and six stories down.
Would the window directly beneath her soon be
belching flames? Would it burn off the rope
before she had reached the ground?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>Panic seized her for an instant. Then, calmly,
she finished the song she had begun a moment
before:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And so we walk together</p>
<p class="t">My Lord and I.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Then, calm as a May morning, she wrapped
her feet about the rope and began the descent,
hand over hand, right, left, right, left. It was
painfully slow, but there was no other way. To
slip was to come to a terrible death.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><br />CHAPTER V
<br />A SHOT FROM AMBUSH</h2>
<p>The strain on Mazie&rsquo;s arms as she let herself
down the rope which hung from the window of
the burning building seemed greater than she
could bear; but with the grim determination of
near despair she worked her way down, hand
over hand, hand over hand.</p>
<p>The palms of her hands burned like fire. In
spite of her greatest efforts her hands slipped
a little, an inch here, an inch there, and the
effect of these slips was like the grasping of a
red hot iron.</p>
<p>One window she passed in safety, another
and another. As she reached the sill of the
fourth her feet touched it. With a dizzy faintness
she steadied herself there and looked down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>The sight that met her eyes was appalling.
The window directly under her belched forth a
sudden burst of red flame. Then, as the wind
shifted, the flames were sucked in again. Was
there hope in that? No. The rope had caught
fire!</p>
<p>Clinging desperately to her place, she hoped
for a clearer moment of consciousness&mdash;and
was granted it.</p>
<p>Calmly she looked down. What was to be
done? She dared not pass that window. A
sudden burst of flame would destroy her. Besides,
she could not. The rope was all but
burned in two.</p>
<p>For a time, because of the smoke, she could
not see below. Then of a sudden it cleared and
she saw firemen ranged around a white circle
directly under her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A net,&rdquo; she breathed.</p>
<p>At the same instant she heard Johnny Thompson&rsquo;s
booming voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go down the rope as far as you dare, then
drop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop?&rdquo; she echoed, &ldquo;how can I?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>Then, as if to mock her, smoke shut off her
view and in the center of the smoke were darting
red flames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can, and I will!&rdquo; she breathed through
tight set teeth. With hands that ached she
gripped the rope and began once more that
agonizing hand over hand descent.</p>
<p>Having gone as far as she dared, she dangled
for ten seconds in midair. At that instant she
caught the sound of Johnny&rsquo;s voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Mazie. Drop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could not see her, but he knew she was
there. A lump rose and stuck in her throat.
Then, with a little upward swing of her feet,
she let go.</p>
<p>It was all over in one wild instant. Smoke,
fire, a mad rush, then a sudden springy shock,
followed by an upward toss, a second bump,
and then Johnny Thompson was helping her
support herself on her unsteady feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;was a very narrow
squeak.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>Hardly had Johnny led Mazie to the emergency
wagon, where her hands were treated and
bandaged, than his mind was once more at
work on his problem&mdash;the origin of this fire
and of all those other fires. It was not that he
was unmindful of the welfare of his friend&mdash;Johnny
was one of the best of friends&mdash;but
the problem was assuming gigantic proportions.
But for the fireproof building standing directly
in its way, this very fire, Marshal Neil had assured
him, would have swept across the city for
a mile and would have left ten thousand homeless
ones in its wake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man who sets these fires,&rdquo; Johnny said
to himself savagely, &ldquo;has no heart, and no sense.
What could be his motive? What could the
city have done to him bad enough to deserve
such a revenge? What could the people of the
city have done? Somehow, somewhere, we
must find him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought of the pink-eyed man. In the
excitement of the rescue he had lost him. Nor
could he find him now, though he searched diligently
for an hour.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll visit his place down there by the river,&rdquo;
he told himself. &ldquo;I may discover something
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had given up the search and, having returned
to Mazie&rsquo;s side, was standing watching
the firemen as they battled with the blaze which
at last was giving way before them. Then he
noticed a man within the lines who did not
wear a fireman&rsquo;s uniform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer looking chap,&rdquo; he whispered to Mazie,
pointing as he spoke.</p>
<p>The man did look queer. He was an extraordinarily
tall man and stooped almost to the
point of deformity. His nose was large and
hooked like a beak. He limped slightly as he
walked. His clothing fitted loosely. His stiff
hat was dented in three places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, you!&rdquo; said a policeman, stepping
up to him, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t stay inside the line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dot&rsquo;s all right, mister.&rdquo; The man showed
his white teeth in a grin, but it wasn&rsquo;t a pleasant
grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to go outside the line.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dot&rsquo;s fair enough, mister.&rdquo; The man
moved away. As he passed Johnny and Mazie
he shot them a piercing glance. Even after
he had gone back to the line of staring spectators,
Johnny felt that his gaze held something
of hatred for him. What was the
meaning of that look? How had the man gotten
within the lines, where only firemen were
allowed? What had he wanted there? He
resolved to keep an eye out for that man in
the future. It was well that he did&mdash;very
well indeed.</p>
<p>After seeing the fire under control and putting
Mazie in a taxi, Johnny went directly
down to the river front. After following a
narrow walk at the river&rsquo;s brink for some
little distance, he stopped to flatten himself
against the wall close to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the place,&rdquo; he whispered to himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>The spot he occupied was completely in
shadows. The night was dark. The uncertain
light from the distant bridge lamps did not
reach him. A person standing ten feet away
could not have seen him. He was at the
entrance to the building which he supposed to
be occupied by the pink-eyed man. He had
hurried to the place as rapidly as possible in
the hope that the man was still out and that
returning to his lair he might reveal something
of himself.</p>
<p>As Johnny stood there in the shadows he
could catch the gleam of reflected light on the
surface of the river. The sight charmed him.
A slow, deep, dirty, sullen sort of stream, was
that river. Flowing between walls of brick,
stone and cement, where once it had meandered
across a great sweep of marshes, it seemed a
prisoner chafing at his bonds.</p>
<p>As Johnny pictured the marshes, whose rushes
had waved over the very spot where he now
stood, he thought of other marshes south of
the city where in hours of idleness, or at times
when he wished to think unmolested, he at
times poked a flat-bottomed boat down the narrow
channels that ran between the rushes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great place to think things through,&rdquo;
he told himself. &ldquo;If nothing comes of this I&rsquo;ll
go down there to-morrow afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do. I&rsquo;ll sleep till
noon, then catch the twelve-thirty train out
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an hour he waited there in the darkness.
Then, growing restless, he gave up hope
of the man&rsquo;s return and decided to do a little
investigating.</p>
<p>Drawing a small flashlight from his pocket
he lighted his way down a narrow passage
that lay between this building and the one next
to it.</p>
<p>On this side, rather high up, he discovered a
small, square window, but large enough to let
a person through. Down the passage he saw
two discarded packing boxes. Working silently,
he put one box on the other, then climbed on
top. He was now on a level with the window.
Flashing his light on the panes, he found them
too dirty to see through. Laying his flashlight
on the top of the box, he tried the window
and to his surprise found it unfastened. It
swung in at his touch like a door on hinges.
At the same moment he felt a slight movement
at his knee, then heard a thud.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My flashlight!&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;Rolled off.
Just have a feel inside anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swinging his feet over the sill, he sat there
for a moment thinking. Should he enter. If
he did, what would he discover? Would he be
in danger?</p>
<p>To his surprise he found that his feet touched
something and without thinking much of what
he was doing he stood up. The next instant,
with a rolling and a crashing that was appalling,
the whole world appeared to sink and
go thundering down beneath him.</p>
<p>A moment later, his nostrils filled with dust
and with something resting on his chest, he
lay quite still and listened.</p>
<p>He caught a faint sound but concluded it
was only scurrying wharf rats. After that the
place was so quiet that he fancied he could hear
the settling of the dust.</p>
<p>What had happened? What was this on his
chest?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>He laughed silently to himself as he put out
a hand to touch it. A barrel&mdash;that was all it
was, an empty barrel. He sensed what had
happened in an instant. He had stood upon
the top of a pyramid of empty barrels. The
bottom of the pyramid had caved in and the
whole heap had gone thundering, carrying
Johnny along.</p>
<p>Two minutes later he was stealing out of
the passage. He had had quite enough of that
place for one night.</p>
<p>Three o&rsquo;clock next day found him in the
center of a marsh whose dark waving bullrushes
stretched away for a mile or more in every
direction. With his coat for a pillow he lay
sprawled out the length of his flat bottomed
boat. A pair of oars and long pole lay at his
side. These would bring him back to shore
when he chose to come. A cold leg of chicken,
a swiss cheese sandwich, a piece of apple pie
and a bottle of milk would appease hunger
when hunger came. He was at peace with the
world and quite prepared to solve all the problems
of the universe with which he had anything
definite to do.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>It was a dreamy day. White clouds moved
slowly across the sky. Cobwebs floated in air.
Now and again a gentle breeze made a softly
sighing sound in the rushes. Just as he was
dreaming himself off into a cat nap a dark
shadow passed over him, then broke suddenly
into a hundred little shadows that were not
shadows at all.</p>
<p>Surprised by this phenomena, which he had
felt rather than seen, he opened his eyes. What
he saw was a large flock of black birds. Contrary
to their usually noisy custom, as if to
avoid disturbing the Sabbath quiet of the place,
they settled every one upon a swaying bullrush
without so much as a single &ldquo;O-ka-lee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old birds!&rdquo; Johnny sighed. And well
he might, for beyond doubt they had been
directed there by the all seeing eye that they
might, in a very short time, be instrumental in
saving his life&mdash;or at least in giving him a
fighting chance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>Knowing nothing of this, he settled back into
his place and once more closed his eyes. These
nights of fire chasing had cost him much sleep.</p>
<p>This time he had fallen quite asleep when,
with a start, he found himself sitting bolt upright.</p>
<p>It was the action of the birds that had
wakened him. With a shrill cry of alarm the
birds had leaped from their swaying perches
and had flown away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I wonder&mdash;&rdquo; Johnny murmured to
himself.</p>
<p>He was given scarcely ten seconds to wonder,
for of a sudden a shot rang out and a bullet
whizzed so close to his cheek that he felt the
sting of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was meant for me!&rdquo; Johnny breathed
tensely.</p>
<p>The next instant he lay flat on his back, his
trembling hands gripping the pole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got to get out of here,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Got
to get out quick, and got to do it lying down.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>Even as the pole silently touched the water,
then sank to grip the bottom, he speculated on
his chance of escape. He was unarmed. At
times he had brought a shot gun to the marsh.
Not to-day. There were no ducks&mdash;to early
in the season.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only chance is to lose him,&rdquo; was his mental
comment as he drove the boat forward into the
channel. At the same time he felt an almost
uncontrollable desire to see the face of the man
who had fired the shot. He had a notion that
were he an artist he could paint the man&rsquo;s picture,
even though he did not see him. In this he
probably was mistaken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><br />CHAPTER VI
<br />THE BLACK SHACK</h2>
<p>As Johnny gave the pole at the side of the
boat a vigorous shove, then another and another,
he found no time for thoughts other than
directing the silent maneuvering of his clumsy
bark. A prod or two on this side, then as the
boat swung to the right the same number of
pokes on the other side, and he moved silently
down the narrow channel. A division in the
narrow course was greeted with delight. If
the man who had fired that shot was following
he could not follow both channels at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That gives me a fifty-fifty chance of escape,&rdquo;
Johnny thought as he chose the right fork.</p>
<p>It is hard work, this poling a boat while lying
flat on one&rsquo;s back. Johnny found himself perspiring
at every pore. Yet he persevered, and
his perseverence was rewarded for, as he moved
slowly forward, he came to a place where the
channel was cut squarely across by another.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A four corners,&rdquo; he rejoiced. &ldquo;I might go
straight ahead, or to the right or left. The
natural thing to do would be to turn right, so
I go left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skilfully he maneuvered the turn and went
gliding down the new channel.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, still lying on his back and
looking up at the clouds, he lifted his pole without
a sound into the boat and then allowed himself
time to think matters through.</p>
<p>Who was this intruder upon his privacy; this
would-be killer? What had been his motive?
Was he connected with the firebug affair? It
would seem so, for in this city Johnny had not
gone against the wishes of anyone save that
firebug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, old boy,&rdquo; he whispered, setting his
teeth tight, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll not get me, and what&rsquo;s more,
give me time and I&rsquo;ll bring your dishonorable
occupation to a sudden halt. See if I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>For a time after that he lay there looking up
at the slow moving clouds, but they brought him
no peace. He was annoyed at the situation that
had so suddenly presented itself. He had come
here to think things through; yet how does one
dare to engage in an all absorbing chain of
thought when at any moment some form of
craft may come gliding in upon him and&mdash;bam!
his head is blown off!</p>
<p>Manifestly there was no thinking to be done.
What then was to be his course?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I lie here baking in the sun till dark,
then sneak away home? Hanged if I do!&rdquo; he
exploded almost out loud. &ldquo;This channel has
some sort of an end that brings a fellow to
shore. I&rsquo;ll poke along down it and when I&rsquo;m
there I&rsquo;ll make a break for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this undertaking he was more fortunate
than he had hoped. He had not poled himself
a hundred rods when he came to the piers of a
low railroad bridge that crossed the swamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh, easy enough,&rdquo; he breathed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>Sitting up, he drove his boat under the bridge
and out on the other side. After that, knowing
that the embankment must hide him from the
enemy if he were still on the marsh, he stood
boldly up, poled his boat to shore, drew her up
beside the railway, then crept up the bank to
peer over at the other half of the marsh. He
was now well above the tops of the rushes and
could plainly see every foot of the marsh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh, fellow&rsquo;d say I dreamed all that,&rdquo; he
grunted. The place was completely deserted.
Even the black birds were gone.</p>
<p>Off on the far side of the marsh he made out
a shack he had never seen there before. A rude
black frame set on posts, it seemed oddly like
some dark ghost of a house that had walked to
the edge of the swamp in the hope of seeing its
reflection in the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if that shack&rsquo;s got anything to do
with&mdash;anything,&rdquo; he mused.</p>
<p>Even as he thought this a man came out of
the place and walking around a corner of the
house disappeared at the back. He was a large
man; that Johnny could tell plainly enough.
And it seemed that the man limped slightly.
But of that he could not be sure, the distance
being too great.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>It was a thoughtful Johnny who walked back
down the track to the nearest station, then took
the train for the city. Matters were getting
serious, very serious indeed, and he had not
thought things through at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go over to the scene of that last
fire,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Do it as soon as I get
to the city. May learn something there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did go there. It was night when he arrived.
The great, black, burned out skeleton of
the Simons Building loomed above him as he
searched, and its vacant window holes stared at
him like the empty sockets of a skull. Somehow
they seemed to accuse him of slowness and stupidity.
He fairly flinched beneath their stare.</p>
<p>His search did not last long. Where the office
of the one time recreation center had been
was now a twenty foot pile of smouldering
rafters, plaster and brick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing to be learned there,&rdquo; he murmured
as he turned away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>At that same moment he caught sight of a
dark shadow that flitted past the corner of the
Simons skeleton, and after that he distinctly
caught a chuckle which ended in well formed
words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is only the beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny shuddered. But courage did not
desert him. With a dash he was around that
corner. His bravery was to no avail. If there
had been a figure there other than a ghost, it
had vanished. Nor did a careful search reveal
any living creature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the beginning,&rdquo; he murmured at last.
&ldquo;This calls for hustle. In the future I shall
use different methods. If I see a suspicious
character, the pink-eyed man or the man with
hooked nose and limp, I shall have him arrested
and look for a reason after. But maybe
I won&rsquo;t see them again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night brought good fortune. As the
clock struck twelve, Johnny was walking
through the zoological garden and there, quite
by chance, ran square into what was to prove
to be one of the most spectacular fires of
history.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fire! Fire! Fire!&rdquo; came ringing out upon
the night.</p>
<p>One sweep of the horizon, then a surprised
exclamation escaped Johnny&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;The Zoo
is on fire!&rdquo; He then made a dash for it.</p>
<p>Fortunately he was not far away; most opportune,
too, was the fact that he knew a great
deal about the Zoo. Endowed with a natural interest
in all living creatures, especially those
of strange lands, he had many times visited this
particular place.</p>
<p>He knew at a glance just where the fire had
its origin. The building was extremely long
and low. Birds and beasts were arranged in
order according to size. First the monkeys, then
wolves, hyena and the like; then lions, tigers
and all other large creatures. At the extreme
west end were two large rooms inhabited by no
living thing. One room was a sort of office
used by the keeper and the other a store room
for a great quantity of material of anthropological
interest, mostly from the Arctic. This
material, no longer upon display, lay heaped
pile upon pile; garments, blankets, spears, harpoons&mdash;all
dry as dust and food for flames. It
was in this store room that the fire was already
fiercely raging.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps there is yet time,&rdquo; Johnny panted
as he came racing up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time for what?&rdquo; demanded a policeman
who had arrived before him. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the
fire department?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be here in a moment.&rdquo; Johnny tried
the office door. It was locked. With a spring
he was away, then back, shoulder first, at the
door with a blow that splintered a panel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, don&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; shouted the policeman,
springing forward.</p>
<p>He was a second too late, for Johnny had
once more rammed the door. The door went in,
and he with it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>The thing he did then would have seemed
strange had there been anyone by to see it. The
fire, already bursting through the partitions,
scorched his face and hands, but into the smoke
he plunged, to drag away, not some object of
great value, but a very ordinary desk telephone.
Gripping the wires of the phone he yanked them
free, then with this trophy under his arm he
made a dash for safety.</p>
<p>Under the screen of smoke he escaped the
eye of the policeman. Having hurried to the
edge of some bushes, he examined the thing
under his arm for a moment, then with a
grumbled: &ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; began coiling the
wire about the phone.</p>
<p>Having done this, he shoved the whole affair
far under the bushes, then turned his face again
toward the fire.</p>
<p>By this time the tumult was appalling. Vying
with the shrill scream of approaching fire
sirens and the clamor of gongs, was the mad
roar of frightened lions and tigers, while above
it all sounded the wild trumpeting of the elephants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a terrible fire,&rdquo; Johnny
shivered. &ldquo;Too terrible to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>At that moment he darted suddenly forward.
He felt sure he had recognized a familiar stooping
figure in the gathering throng. Johnny
had decided that it was about time to begin
making a few arrests and ask questions later.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><br />CHAPTER VII
<br />THE BURNING OF THE ZOO</h2>
<p>One moment Johnny sighted the familiar,
stooping figure, the next he had lost him in the
throng which appeared to have sprung up from
the ground. However, he did not despair of
finding him again. As for the fire, it was now
none of his affair. Terrible as it promised to
be, he could do nothing to stop it. That was
the firemen&rsquo;s part. Already they were stretching
their hose. After a single thought given
to the safety of the trophy he had hidden under
the bushes, Johnny bent his every thought and
energy toward the finding of that man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;it may result in the
unravelling of a great mystery and bring to
a sudden end a series of great catastrophes.&rdquo;
At that he lost himself in the throng.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>With the firemen came Mazie. She had gone
to the central alarm station in the hope of finding
Johnny there. Instead she had found the
Chief. When the first and second alarms came
in from the Zoo alarm box, the Chief had
bundled her into his car and they had raced
for the park.</p>
<p>Hardly had she alighted from the Chief&rsquo;s car
at the scene of the fire than she felt a slight
touch on her shoulder and, on looking up, saw
that Jerry, the firemen&rsquo;s monkey mascot, was on
her shoulder.</p>
<p>She was not surprised at this, but so pleased
that tears glistened in her eyes. From the
time Jerry had saved her life by bringing a
rope to her in the burning building, he had
apparently thought of her as his especial charge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>Seeing the Chief about to enter the burning
Zoo behind the firemen with the spurting hose in
their hands, Mazie took his arm to enter with
him. Though he frowned at her, he did not
say no. It was a terrible sight that met her
eyes. Just as they entered, the fire broke
through the wooden partition between the office
and that portion of the Zoo set apart for birds.
The fluttering and screaming of frightened birds
was almost more than she could stand. Beautiful
yellow canaries, brown warblers, parrots of
gorgeous green, magnificent birds of paradise,
tropical birds with plumage as varied as the
hues of the rainbow&mdash;they one and all beat
their wings against their cages and cried for
freedom as they never had cried before in all
their captive lives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all in vain,&rdquo; the girl fairly sobbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; muttered the Chief grimly, &ldquo;we
may save the animals, but this part of the Zoo
is doomed. C&rsquo;mon. Let&rsquo;s get out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reluctantly the girl turned away. As she did
so she saw a single yellow canary in a small
cage near the door&mdash;the commonest bird in the
world. Why he was there alone she could not
tell. She only knew that out of all that priceless
collection here was one that might be saved.
Seizing the cage, she tore it from its hanging,
then followed the Chief into the outer air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dear little bird,&rdquo; she whispered, as she hung
the cage high on the limb of a tree well away
from danger, &ldquo;I have given you a new bit
of life. May you sing long and sweetly for
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more she joined the fire-fighting throng.
She was hoping all the time to come upon
Johnny. This was the kind of fire he was
supposed to investigate. He must be here, but
where?</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might be in there,&rdquo; she thought to herself
as she followed a band of fire fighters into
the long, low compartment occupied by the
monkey tribe. Jerry, who was still on her
shoulder, let out a scream of delight at sight of
so many of his kind. His scream was answered
by one long wail of terror, for at that very
moment a broad tongue of fire came licking
through the thin wooden ceiling of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the garret,&rdquo; muttered the fireman.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a garret running the length of the
building. There&rsquo;s a company coming against
the fire from up there. We can probably stop
it here, but this place is doomed. Unless we
can get &rsquo;em out, every monkey of the lot will
burn.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>There had been times when, in her dreams,
Mazie had seen human faces distorted with fear,
peering down from windows where flames
reached out to grip them. But nothing she had
ever dreamed of could be as bad as the sight
of hundreds of monkeys, baboons, apes and
chimpanzees, clinging to their cages and uttering
plaintive cries and wild shrieks while their man-like
faces were shrunken with fear.</p>
<p>In vain did their keepers attempt to call them
down to the doors through which they might
escape.</p>
<p>It seemed that they, like the birds, must meet
a terrible death. But just when matters were
at the worst, Mazie felt a tearing at the shoulder
of her coat and turned to see Jerry snatched
from his place there. To her surprise and consternation,
she saw that the man who held the
mascot tightly in his right hand was none other
than the pink-eyed man whom she and Johnny
suspected of being the firebug.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stop him!&rdquo; she fairly screamed.</p>
<p>But she was too late. The man was already
well away and up to the side of the great cage
of monkeys. In his left hand he held a fireman&rsquo;s
axe.</p>
<p>The thing Mazie witnessed in the next three
minutes impressed a picture on the sensitized
film of her brain that she will never forget.</p>
<p>Holding Jerry up to the cage, the pink-eyed
man allowed him to cling there for a full half
minute. During that entire time the strange
little creature kept up an incessant chatter that
could be heard even above the screams of the
frightened prisoners.</p>
<p>What it was he said, Mazie could not tell. She
did realize that this monkey speech of his had
an extraordinary effect upon the other monkeys.
By the time his half minute speech was up, the
screams had died down nearly to a whisper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>It was at this psychological moment that the
pink-eyed man made his next move. With a
single stroke of his axe he cut a perpendicular
gash four feet long in the heavy wire screening
of the cage. A second slash made a horizontal
one quite as long. By turning out the ragged
corners he made a large hole there. On the
edge of this hole he placed Jerry.</p>
<p>Then came the astonishing thing. Jerry
seemed to understand his part for, with a twist
of his head toward the nearest monkey, he appeared
to say: &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon.&rdquo; Then, catching hold
of the cage, he executed a swinging jump and
landed on the floor. The foremost monkey in
the cage followed his example, then another and
another.</p>
<p>Calmly the pink-eyed man slashed the side of
cage after cage and out of each leaped all those
man-like creatures, and man-like still, as if obeying
orders, they each and all joined the procession
led by Jerry. The procession grew and
grew and grew until at last there was not a
living creature in the cages.</p>
<p>There arose a hoarse shout of approval from
the firemen. Mazie looked around for the hero
of the hour&mdash;the pink-eyed man. He had vanished!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>As she made her way once more into the open
air of the park that surrounded the Zoo, she
found the trees full of happy chattering creatures
who were enjoying to the full such freedom
as they had not known for years.</p>
<p>For a time she stood there staring at the
burning building. As she turned to go, there
came a chatter from the tree above her, followed
by a thud on her shoulder.</p>
<p>It was Jerry. With cap gone, his red coat
scorched and torn, he still appeared to be the
happiest monkey in all the world.</p>
<p>The firemen by this time had the fire somewhat
under control, but the mingled sounds of
screams, roars and trumpetings which came
from the other end of the Zoo was all but
deafening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>Having always had a desire to know how
different wild animals acted under stress of
danger, Mazie decided to re-enter the Zoo and
pass through it until stopped by the fire. She
could not do this without considerable fear and
trembling, nor was this entirely unwarranted.
The time was to come, and that within the next
quarter of an hour, when she would regret so
rash an undertaking.</p>
<p class="tb">In the meantime, what had become of Johnny?
While all these things were happening to Mazie
and her strange companion, Jerry, what success
had he had in finding his man?</p>
<p>It is not easy to locate a particular person
in a throng of five hundred or a thousand people
at night. Johnny thought he knew all about
that. He had entered upon just such a task
more than once before. More than once, too,
he had found himself baffled, beaten back by the
mob, in the end defeated. This time he was
determined to win.</p>
<p>But even as he entered into the search he
asked himself seriously whether or not he had
any business with the man he sought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may, and I may not,&rdquo; he mumbled to himself
at last, &ldquo;but one thing is sure&mdash;this thing
has got to stop. When the police can&rsquo;t pin a
thing on a particular man they go out looking
for suspects and bring in every suspicious looking
character. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll have to do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>At once his mind was at work on possibilities.
Two men had come under suspicion; the pink-eyed
man and the man with the hooked nose
and the limp. If either was the firebug, which
was it most likely to be? Johnny remembered
the look he had seen on the face of the pink-eyed
man the night of the school house fire. It
was a look of pleasure which had seemed to say:
&ldquo;I set the fire. Isn&rsquo;t it grand!&rdquo; And yet, had
he read that look correctly? One thing was
sure&mdash;a moment later the look had vanished
from the man&rsquo;s face and he was showing an
active interest in the saving of a child from the
school building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; thought Johnny, &ldquo;would tend
to make a fellow love him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the other hand,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;he lives in
a disreputable looking place; at least I saw him
go in there. And he was at that second fire.
What&rsquo;s he doing at every midnight fire if he has
nothing to do with them?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>As for the man who limped, he had seen him
at but one fire, and that time there was nothing
of a suspicious character revealed other than his
presence behind the lines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet I have a sneaking notion,&rdquo; Johnny
mused, &ldquo;that it was he who shot at me out
there on the marsh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much proof for that conclusion,
either,&rdquo; he murmured a moment later.</p>
<p>His mind went back to the double telephone
wires he had found in the burned schoolhouse
and the one he had hidden beneath the bushes
but a few moments before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might be something to it,&rdquo; he said suddenly
and quite out loud. &ldquo;Might&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke short off. Over to the right he had
caught sight of his man&mdash;the one who limped,
and to his great joy he found the fire Chief
close beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; he exclaimed, gripping at the Chief&rsquo;s
arm, &ldquo;See that man! Get that man! He&mdash;he&mdash;perhaps
he&rsquo;s the firebug!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>The Chief made a lunge toward the man.
Johnny followed. It did look too as if he had
spoken the truth, for the instant the Chief made
a move in his direction the suspected man was
away. Not fast enough, however, to escape
Johnny&rsquo;s keen eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way, Chief,&rdquo; he exclaimed, then dashed
straight away from the fire toward the shore
of the lake, whence came the dull roar of rolling
breakers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><br />CHAPTER VIII
<br />MAZIE AND THE TIGER</h2>
<p>With fear in her heart Mazie again entered
the burning Zoo. This was the most spectacular
fire she had ever known anything about and
she was determined to see it through to its very
end.</p>
<p>Giving a wide berth to three elephants who
were blowing hay in air, trumpeting and threshing
madly at their chains, with a gulp of pity she
passed the patient camels who, seeming resigned
to their fate, stood with heads hanging low.</p>
<p>She shuddered as she saw the restless pacing
and heard the deafening roar of lions, and
started back in fear when a great black leopard
leaped squarely against the bars that held him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>The bars were strong. She saw the mad
creature drop back stunned, then she pressed on
into the room where the firemen were doing
noble battle with the flames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re winning,&rdquo; she said to a grimy fireman.
There was admiration in her tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll soon be over now.
But,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;we wouldn&rsquo;t have saved the
monkeys if it hadn&rsquo;t been for Jerry. He&rsquo;s a
wise little rascal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry and&mdash;and that man,&rdquo; said Mazie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; old Pinkie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he? Do you know him?&rdquo; Mazie
asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Miss, I can&rsquo;t just say I know him, but
all of us have seen him often. Regular fire
fan. Seems like he goes to every fire that&rsquo;s of
any consequence. He&rsquo;s a queer one. Seems to
have a heart of gold, though. I&rsquo;ve seen him risk
his life to save an alley cat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he couldn&rsquo;t be&mdash;&rdquo; Mazie suddenly cut
herself short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t be what, Miss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mazie didn&rsquo;t answer. &ldquo;How long have you
seen him around fires?&rdquo; she asked instead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Seems like it&rsquo;s been three years or more.
I recall the first time. It was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Look!&rdquo; Mazie&rsquo;s eyes opened wide with
terror. And well they might. A tall chimney,
undermined by the fire, had come crashing down
through the roof. It had not stopped at the
roof but had come on through, crushing an iron
cage where were imprisoned two royal Bengal
tigers. So thoroughly mashed was the cage that
it resembled a bird cage which has been stepped
on by a large man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; Mazie screamed, as with a
growl of rage and pain the larger of the two
captives sprang through an opening, free!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p class="tb">And what of Johnny and the Chief? They
had gone rushing after that man whom Johnny
had so rashly named the firebug. He had led
them straight away across a level stretch of
grass, across a drive and through a clump of
bushes to the shore of the lake. There, with
a speed that was astonishing in so large a man
who was at the same time a little lame, with
cold spray drenching him, he ran on along the
stone breakwater to a spot where a second
breakwater ran off at a sharp angle to the first.
This wall of stone which ran between two
stretches of foaming water reached to a fill some
distance out in the lake. It was incomplete.
Only rough and jagged piles of rock marked
its course; as yet there were no beams.</p>
<p>At such a time as this, when seas were running
high, it was little less than suicide to venture
out upon it; yet the mysterious man did not
hesitate an instant. One second he was on the
solid shore, the next he was balancing himself
on a jagged pile of rocks five yards out to sea,
and then he was lost to view in a cloud of
spray.</p>
<p>The man had probably figured that his pursuers
would not dare to follow. In this he was
partly wrong. Johnny&rsquo;s foot was on the foremost
rock when the Chief&rsquo;s firm hand pulled him
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he rumbled, &ldquo;he can&rsquo;t make it. He&rsquo;ll
have to come back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>They did wait, and for a time it seemed that
the Chief was certainly right; that the man
would never succeed in making his way to the
broad stretch of filled land which ran for more
than a mile along the lake front, and where he
might either hide or make his way back to land
over some pier or safer breakwater. But, as
the spray cleared, they saw him twenty yards
out, now thirty, forty, fifty, sixty. Then, for a
long time, as the water boomed against the
rocks, the spray completely hid the fleeing form.</p>
<p>Then, of a sudden, the moon came out and
the spray cleared for a moment. At that moment,
after sharply surveying the length of the
breakwater, the Chief and Johnny turned to
stare at one another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a living thing there now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t have made his way to the fill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably not. Might have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone. Nothing could save him. No
one could climb back upon that breakwater once
he was washed off. May God rest his soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a full ten minutes they stood there watching
the surface of the water, then turning
silently about, started back toward the scene
of the fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><br />CHAPTER IX
<br />A MYSTERIOUS ISLAND</h2>
<p>Many of the expected thrills and terrors of
life never materialize. It was so with Mazie
and the tiger. If the tiger had been roaring in
a manner fit to curdle the blood of a pirate, it
was because he was afraid. The instant he was
free from his cage, acting for all the world like
a cat that has suddenly been drenched with cold
water, he went slinking away down the long
rooms of the zoo.</p>
<p>It was a simple enough matter to drive him
into a portable cage, and there the affair ended.</p>
<p>An hour later, Mazie came upon the Chief,
who told her of Johnny&rsquo;s experience but could
not inform her of his whereabouts. Failing to
find him, she decided to go home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>After taking Jerry back to his master, she returned
to the tree where she had placed the
rescued canary. Wrapping her cape about the
cage to shield the bird from the chill night air,
she hailed a taxi and sped along home, content
to call it a night.</p>
<p class="tb">Johnny was not at all convinced that the Chief
was right in saying that the stooped man with
the hook nose and a limp had fallen into the lake
and been drowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get rid of a man that easily,&rdquo; he
told himself. &ldquo;They do it in the movies; but
in real life, not once in a million times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The more he thought of it, the surer he became
that he was right. The moon had been
under a cloud for a long time, long enough for
the man to have escaped over the breakwater to
the made land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And besides,&rdquo; Johnny reasoned, &ldquo;he was
just as likely to fall in on the side of the breakwater
away from the spray as he was on the
dangerous side. On that side it would have
been no trick at all to swim to the shore of that
made land.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>Having convinced himself that the affair
would bear looking into, he retraced his steps
to the lake shore. The wind had gone down.
The moon was shining. The breakwater appeared
to offer a safe passage to the land beyond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll chance it,&rdquo; he murmured to himself.</p>
<p>As the reader already knows, the unfinished
breakwater was composed of sharp edged limestone
rock, together with broken fragments of
cement taken from old sidewalks and cellar
walls. To cross from shore to shore was no
easy task, even now. More than once Johnny
was obliged to drop on his knees to save himself
a slide into the water. As he saw how
perilous the passage was he was all but forced
to believe that the Chief&rsquo;s conclusion was correct,
that the fugitive had been drowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if he did,&rdquo; Johnny thought to himself,
&ldquo;and if he was the firebug, then this chase is
ended and, what&rsquo;s more, he took his secret with
him to the bottom of the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>This thought left him a feeling of disappointment
so keen that it threw him into a fit of
despondency. He knew well enough that he
should be glad that the man was gone. The
city would then see the end of the havoc that
had added so much to the discomfort and unhappiness
of its people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But all the same,&rdquo; he told himself defiantly,
&ldquo;that fellow had some secret method for setting
fires, an unusual and unknown method.
It is decidedly disappointing, after you had been
for so long a time hot on the trail, to have
that secret buried from your sight forever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is to be, will be,&rdquo; he mused as
he picked his way across the final rugged stretch
of cold, wet rock.</p>
<p>When at last his feet touched solid dry land
again, his feeling that the man had certainly
been drowned left him. Such experiences are
not uncommon. One&rsquo;s feeling toward all of life
during a time of peril is always different from
that which he experiences in a place of comparative
safety.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>Strange to say, however, Johnny was, at the
moment he stepped on that made land, in greater
peril than he had been at any time while crossing
the slippery breakwater. Being quite unconscious
of this, he struck boldly down the
length of that narrow stretch of land.</p>
<p>It was a curious sort of island on which he
stood. A city that had built skyscrapers to
its very water front, becoming dissatisfied with
the waterscape that lay out before it, had decided
that a few islands off its shores would
add to the decorative effect of its view. So,
with the fearless, Titan-like soul that possesses
American cities, it had decided to build islands
here and there along its shores. This narrow
stretch of land, a few hundred yards wide and
a mile long, was their first attempt at altering
the face of nature.</p>
<p>At the present time, like the world in its
beginning, it was &ldquo;without form and void.&rdquo;
Upon the great mounds of dripping sand raised
up from the bottom by dredges, had been hauled
all manner of refuse from the land. Loads of
clay, great heaps of tin cans, dump loads of
broken brick and mortar, caused this man made
island to look like the side of a volcano after
an eruption.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>Johnny found it a very difficult place to walk.
One moment he was climbing a mound of clay,
the next he was wading knee-deep in soft sand,
and after that rattling through a whole desert
of tin cans.</p>
<p>For all that, there was a certain thrill to be
had from walking there. He was upon an island.
As far as he knew the island was without
an inhabitant. Certainly two years before
it was entirely unknown to the civilized world.</p>
<p>He chuckled at the thoughts he had thus conjured
up. &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he laughed, &ldquo;the island
is within gunshot of one of the largest cities of
our land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If he had concluded that the place was entirely
deserted, he was destined to a rude and shocking
disillusionment. Suddenly, out from behind
a tall heap of rubbish, a large figure launched
itself at him with such sure effect that it sent
him crashing to the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>Now Johnny, as you will know well enough if
you have read our other book &ldquo;Triple Spies,&rdquo;
was not the sort of a fellow to take the count on
the first down. It would have been a nimble
tongued referee who could have counted three
before Johnny was getting to his feet.</p>
<p>Thoroughly aroused and angered by this
sudden, cowardly assault, he was now quite
ready for trouble.</p>
<p>He did not have long to wait for it, either.
At once the man came at him. This time someone
received a surprise, and it certainly was not
Johnny. Came a sound as of a wagon tongue
ramming an automobile, and the huge hulk of a
man who had started the row, staggered backward.
Boxing was the one thing Johnny knew
a great deal about. Long years ago his father
had taught him a great deal about defending
himself. He had added to this knowledge as
the years went by.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>Johnny had not the slightest doubts of his
ability along these lines. But that he was in
grave danger, he knew quite well. While his
assailant paused before resuming the attack, he
allowed himself a few darting thoughts as to
how this affair would end. Who was this man?
Could he be the man they had driven out upon
the breakwater, or was he some tramp who had
come out here to sleep? Was he armed? If he
had a knife or gun the affair would probably
end shortly and tragically. Was it best to run?
Probably it was, but being Johnny Thompson, he
did not propose to run. He&rsquo;d stand his ground
and fight, and since fight he must, why not on
the offensive? No sooner thought than done.
With muscles tense, every nerve alert, he leaped
squarely at the astonished giant.</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s chance came and he took it. As the
man threw up his hands in an involuntary motion
to shield his face, Johnny landed a haymaker
square on his chin.</p>
<p>There are few men who can withstand such
a blow but this man appeared to be made of
uncommon stuff. He staggered like a drunken
man but he did not fall. The next second he
set his huge fists swinging.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>As Johnny stepped back he stumbled over
some hard object and all but fell. The obstacle
suggested a way out, but he did not take it. In
this ten seconds of confused thought he was
suddenly seized in a death-like grip. The man,
so much heavier, bore him to the ground with a
crash that all but knocked his senses out of him.</p>
<p>In the struggle that followed his hand was
pressed against something hard at the man&rsquo;s
belt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A knife!&rdquo; Johnny thought excitedly.</p>
<p>The next instant his hand was on the hilt.
Ten seconds of struggle and he had freed the
hand with the long-bladed knife gripped tight.</p>
<p>Wildly his heart beat. The advantage was
his. Should he follow it up? One thrust, perhaps
two, and the struggle would end.</p>
<p>A second of thought. &ldquo;No! No! Not
that!&rdquo; Suddenly his hand shot up and out.
The knife, executing the arc of a circle, clanged
to the ground some distance away.</p>
<p>A short, tense struggle followed, then again
Johnny was free.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>Breathing hard, hair disheveled, face bloody,
clothes torn, he backed away to allow his mind
three more flashing thoughts: &ldquo;What next?
Fight or flee? How will it end?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He would fight. The man might be the firebug.
If he could but subdue and capture him,
the prize was won. Besides, had not the man
set upon him from ambush? Did he not deserve
a drubbing?</p>
<p>Suddenly he felt a strong desire to see the
man&rsquo;s face. If he were the man he thought
him, he would recognize him. The man&rsquo;s back
was to the moon. Johnny executed a flank
movement, that the moon might give him a view
of that face. Again he tripped and all but fell.
One hand touched the ground. It rested for
a second on half a brick. Should he seize the
brick? It was a weapon! But he had always
fought fair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; he breathed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>He had always fought fair. Little did he
know of the ruthless warfare of the underworld,
of those denizens of crime who seize any weapon,
who strike any creature&mdash;even the defenseless
and weak&mdash;whose creed is ruthlessness and
cruelty, and who know neither honor nor pity.</p>
<p>Well had it been if Johnny had known, for
hardly had his hand left the brick than another
came crashing against his own head, sending
him crumpling down like an empty sack.</p>
<p>Consciousness did not entirely desert him. He
had lost the power to move, but could still hear,
feel and think. He caught the heavy thud of
the villain&rsquo;s footsteps as he approached, felt his
hot breath on his cheek, then saw him lift the
very brick he himself, but ten seconds before,
had rejected as a point of honor.</p>
<p>His thoughts ran rampant. All his past lay
before him, all his hopes for the future. He had
expected to die sometime, somewhere, but not
like this, not alone on a island built up by dump
carts and scows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! Not here!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>At the instant when all seemed lost, he heard
a sudden compact, saw the big man go hurdling
over him, and then to his vast surprise heard
him struggle to his feet to go clump-clumping
away.</p>
<p>Then, as a clearer consciousness came ebbing
back, Johnny opened his eyes to see a face
looking down upon him; a strange, wizened,
full-bearded face that seemed the face of an
overgrown owl.</p>
<p>For a time he felt that he must have become
delirious, and was seeing things in mad dreams.
Just then the man spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurt much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;no. Guess&mdash;guess not,&rdquo; Johnny said,
struggling to a sitting posture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. When you feel like it I&rsquo;ll help
you over to my house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your house? Where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the island, just round the corner here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A house on this island?&rdquo; Johnny whispered
to himself. &ldquo;Why, then, this surely is a
mysterious island.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><br />CHAPTER X
<br />BEN ZOOK</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Johnny asked as he sat
staring at this strange little man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben Zook&rsquo;s my name. What might be
yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny Thompson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was you doin&rsquo; on my island, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looking for a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Find him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m not sure. I was trying to find out
whether I had found him or not when he hit
me with a brick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It probably was him,&rdquo; said Ben thoughtfully.</p>
<p>For a moment the two of them sat staring
away at the dark waters of the lake. Then Ben
spoke:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if your gyroscope&rsquo;s workin&rsquo; sufficient
well to let you navigate without too much of
a list to starboard, we might set sail. I&rsquo;ve got
some coffee, and I guess there&rsquo;s still a fire.
It will do you good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Johnny, struggling to his feet
and standing there unsteadily, &ldquo;yes, I think it
would. Lead on, friend. Sort of map out the
route for me, will you? I&rsquo;m a stranger in
these parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought you might be,&rdquo; chuckled Ben.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t have many visitors, I don&rsquo;t, an&rsquo; most of
&rsquo;em&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;d call of an undesirable class&mdash;bums
that&rsquo;s been run off the parks, mostly. Me&mdash;I&rsquo;m
no bum. I earn my living. I feed the
chickens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny thought that a rather strange occupation
in a city of three million. Since he was
too busy watching his steps over the irregular
surface of made land to give attention to other
things, he let the thing stand as it was for the
present.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Probably just a way of saying something
else, I guess; hasn&rsquo;t a thing to do with real
poultry,&rdquo; was his mental comment.</p>
<p>In a surprisingly short time Johnny found
himself nearing that side of the island next to
the lake, and a moment later was led to a spot
where red coals glowed in a sort of out-of-doors
fireplace fashioned from broken bits of brick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s my house,&rdquo; said Ben Zook, a touch
of pride in his tone. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not everyone that
lives in a brick house these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first Johnny thought he referred to the
rude fireplace and was prepared to laugh; but,
as he turned about he caught sight of a dark,
cavern-like hole in the side of a great mound
of clay. Even as he looked his newly found
friend lighted a candle. The mellow glow of
this tiny lighting plant revealed three walls of
brick and mortar and a roof of wood. The
whole place was not over ten feet square, and
the ceiling was barely above his head. There
were no windows and no door, but the end
next to the fire stood open and that served the
place of both.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of it?&rdquo; asked Ben Zook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Johnny heartily, &ldquo;that had
Robinson Crusoe come upon a home like this
on his island he would have wept for joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, so he would, Johnny, so he would!&rdquo;
exclaimed Ben, more than pleased by this compliment
to his extraordinary abode.</p>
<p>A half hour later, Johnny&rsquo;s slight wounds
having been quite skilfully dressed by his surprising
host and his spirits revived by a strong
cup of black coffee, the two sat staring out at
the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do men come out here often?&rdquo; Johnny
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so often. It ain&rsquo;t safe crossing on the
breakwater. I&rsquo;ve got a sort of flat bottomed
boat I paddle across with every morning when
I go over to feed the chickens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There it was again. &ldquo;The&mdash;the chickens?&rdquo;
Johnny stammered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I got a regular job. Don&rsquo;t pay very
big, but it keeps me, and besides, when a chicken
gets sick and looks like he&rsquo;d die, they give him
to me. I bring &rsquo;em out here and dope &rsquo;em
up. Then if they get all right I take &rsquo;em back
and sell &rsquo;em. I&rsquo;ve got five chickens, a guinea
hen and a goose right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are these chickens you feed?&rdquo;
Johnny asked, more perplexed than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Commission house. South Water Street.
Come in by car loads and in crates and have
to be fed, you know. I feed &rsquo;em an&rsquo; water &rsquo;em.
That&rsquo;s my job. An&rsquo; this island, it&rsquo;s my chicken
ranch. Roam all over it, my poultry does, in
the daytime. At night I shut &rsquo;em up. I&rsquo;d like
a better place, where there was grass an&rsquo; shade,
but seems like a fellow can&rsquo;t save enough for
that. This here island, it don&rsquo;t cost me nothin&rsquo;.
They just let me stay here, the park folks do.
An&rsquo; the house, it didn&rsquo;t cost nothin&rsquo; neither, only
the price of a bag of lime. Sand came from
the lake; bricks I picked up from rubbish piles.
Pretty neat, &rsquo;eh?&rdquo; He proudly surveyed his
three walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty neat,&rdquo; Johnny agreed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I like it best with the end open to the fire.
It&rsquo;s more healthy. But if folks are goin&rsquo; to
come out here at night, &rsquo;taint goin&rsquo; to be safe.
I&rsquo;ll haf to build a door. Not folks like you, but
that other fellow&rsquo;s kind. Seems like I&rsquo;ve seen
that man out here before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big man&mdash;with a stoop and a limp?&rdquo;
Johnny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a hooked nose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t see his face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was he doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Standin&rsquo; with his back to the island and his
face toward the city, an&rsquo; far&rsquo;s I could tell he was
standin&rsquo; there a shakin&rsquo; his big fists at the
city an&rsquo; a swearin&rsquo; fit to kill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was just what he would do if he is the
man I think him to be,&rdquo; said Johnny, quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would he now? What&rsquo;d anybody do a
crazy thing like that for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tell me,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;There are
some like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crooks and cranks,&rdquo; said Ben. &ldquo;Why
didn&rsquo;t you hit him first?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I did, but he had a hard head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit him with a brick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my fist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never do that to a crook, Johnny. They
wouldn&rsquo;t do that to you. Put &rsquo;em to sleep with
the best thing you can grab, then argue with
&rsquo;em after they wake up. Talk about honor
among thieves; there ain&rsquo;t none. They&rsquo;re a low
lived lot, too lazy to work. Half of them have
got heads like kids and the other half are full
of hop. A dirty bunch of low lifed cowards
who take knives and guns to rob people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; look at the stuff they write about &rsquo;em
in them there paper books and magazines.
You&rsquo;d think they was high class gentlemen
down on their luck and doin&rsquo; an honest turn by
robbin&rsquo; some one just so as to get back on
their feet again, wouldn&rsquo;t you? Or mebby
goin&rsquo; in for it as a sort of sporting proposition.
Livin&rsquo; dangerously, they&rsquo;d call it. Danger!
It&rsquo;s their victim that gets the danger! Honor!
Romance! Living dangerously! Bah! Hit &rsquo;em
first, that&rsquo;s my motto!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; said Johnny, rubbing his bruised
head, &ldquo;is going to be my motto in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the next opportunity presented itself
Johnny did not forget this resolve. He followed
it through, and with the most astonishing results.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben,&rdquo; said Johnny a moment later, &ldquo;I want
to keep in touch with you. That fellow may
come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I been thinkin&rsquo; an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t like
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you wouldn&rsquo;t. And if he did
you&rsquo;d want him taken care of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly would, Johnny, unless I could
get close enough without him seein&rsquo; me to take
care of him with a brick.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do anything rash,&rdquo; Johnny continued.
&ldquo;If he shows up, let me know. I&rsquo;ve got a room
facing the water front. I&rsquo;ll bet you can see that
window from the place where you work. There&rsquo;s
a door at the back of the building. You&rsquo;ll know
the place; the first building to the right after
you cross Wells Street bridge. That back door
isn&rsquo;t locked. In a dark corner behind the door
is a small box with a slot in it. If that man
comes back you just hop right over there and
slip an orange wrapper in that box. There&rsquo;s
plenty of them in South Water Street. That
will be a message to me, and it won&rsquo;t tell a
thing to anyone else, even if they rob the box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Johnny, I&rsquo;ll do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time they sat there staring at the lake.
Then slowly their heads drooped, and with arms
crossed like their primitive ancestors, the ape-men,
they sat on this strange island so near and
yet so far from a great city, sat by the fire
asleep, but ever ready at the slightest sound to
seize a club or a stone in defense of their
lives and Ben Zook&rsquo;s crude home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><br />CHAPTER XI
<br />JOHNNY GETS A TIP</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; began the Chief as Johnny entered
the office late that afternoon, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a man in
town I want you to watch. I want&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly he paused to stare at the swollen
side of Johnny&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;Who hit you?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I got a bump there.&rdquo; Johnny did not
wish to tell the Chief about his island experience.
He was afraid the Chief would not like his going
against advice; and besides, if something came
of this little excursion, something really big,
he felt that he had a right when the time was
ripe to spring it as a surprise. He was truly
relieved when the Chief did not press the
question.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;As I was about to say,&rdquo; the Chief resumed,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s a man come to town recently,
a man I want you to get in touch with if you
can. That is, I mean locate and shadow him.
The fact that he wasn&rsquo;t here at the time this
series of fires started doesn&rsquo;t necessarily prove
that he hasn&rsquo;t a hand in them. The brains of
a gang is not always on the spot all the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man,&rdquo; he leaned forward in his chair,
&ldquo;is credited with a dozen big blazes in New
York, and now he&rsquo;s come to Chicago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been credited with them but, shrewd
as the New York police are and persistent as
were the insurance patrols, not one of these
fires has been surely pinned on him. So here
he is in Chicago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His name is Knobs Whittaker; at least
Knobs is what he goes by. The reason for the
name is that on each side of his bald head, well
above his ears, is a sort of knob. You&rsquo;ve seen
cattle that had their horns treated when they
were calves and had no horns to speak of&mdash;just
knobs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, his knobs are like that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sort of a dehorned Devil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly that, from what I hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said the Chief after fumbling about
in the pigeon holes of his desk, &ldquo;is the address
where he was last seen. He was seen entering
the door that leads up the stairs to the second
floor. I wish you&rsquo;d go over there this morning
and give the place the once over. You may
see Knobs, though I doubt it. Anyway, fix
the building in your mind and find out all you
can about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; said Johnny as he pocketed the slip
of paper handed to him.</p>
<p>The place, he noted, was on Randolph near
Franklin, not five blocks from his own room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right down town,&rdquo; he thought to himself.
&ldquo;Lot of wholesale shops in there; shoes,
plumbing goods, machinery, and the like. Very
respectable place. You wouldn&rsquo;t look for anything
queer in there; but then, you never can
tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this conclusion Johnny was right.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>The building to which he had been directed,
and where Knobs had last been seen, proved to
be a narrow four-story structure with a small
square hallway at the front. On the right side
of this hallway one might read the names of
the occupants. On the first floor was a manufacturing
chemist; on the second a wholesale
diamond merchant; on the third a publisher of
cheap juvenile books; and the fourth had been
taken over by the National Novelty Company,
whatever that might be.</p>
<p>Johnny was studying this board and beginning
to wonder in a vague sort of way if the
top floor had been taken over by Knobs and if
he thought his business of setting fire as being
in a way a distinct novelty, when a broad shouldered,
smooth shaven man of neat appearance
alighted from the small elevator and, as men
will do, removed his hat to dust his bald head
with a silk handkerchief.</p>
<p>Johnny took in the top of that head at a
glance. With great difficulty he suppressed an
exclamation of surprise. Above each ear there
was a distinct, glistening knob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>With the greatest of effort he tore his gaze
from the man and, leaping into the elevator,
called hurriedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Third floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had taken the elevator because he did not
wish to fall under the suspicions glance of that
man. He had chosen the third floor because he
was quite sure books were safe; this notorious
firebug would have nothing to do with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that,&rdquo; he thought to himself as the elevator
crept upward, &ldquo;is Knobs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He found himself tremendously impressed by
the appearance of the man. He had personality,
which is more than one may say of most of his
kind. He looked dangerous, a square-jawed villain
who would stop at nothing.</p>
<p>Because he had been so greatly impressed and
also because Knobs had twice been seen in the
building, Johnny made a careful survey of the
premises. The diamond merchant&rsquo;s place on the
second floor, he discovered, was well wired with
a noted burglar insurance company&rsquo;s apparatus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder at that,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;With such men as Knobs about, it&rsquo;s highly
necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the third floor he found a hallway leading
to a back window. The window looked
down upon the roof of a two-story building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One could reach that roof at a leap if he
found it necessary,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<p>He had not expected to find the Novelty Company
open for business. They weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess that&rsquo;s about all I can discover for
this time,&rdquo; he concluded as he once more entered
the elevator and dropped to the ground floor.</p>
<p>The Chief was well pleased with his report.
&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d make an inspector,
give you time. There&rsquo;s one thing you wouldn&rsquo;t
know, though, so I&rsquo;ll tell you. A chemist&rsquo;s establishment
or a drug store is one of the most dangerous
risks an insurance company can take.
That&rsquo;s because if it gets on fire it goes up like a
flash. There are likely to be dangerous fumes
that drive the firemen back, and perhaps an explosion;
too many chemicals about and in time
of fire they raise the very deuce!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand why that is, eh?
Well, that&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re no chemist. I&rsquo;ve
dabbled into it a bit, and you&rsquo;d better when you
get time. It pays to know a little about many
things, and a lot about one thing. That&rsquo;s what
makes a useful citizen out of a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you about those chemicals. There&rsquo;s
always lots of chlorides and sulphur about a
chemist&rsquo;s shop. If the chlorides are heated at all
they give up oxygen, and oxygen will make anything
burn&mdash;a wrought-iron pipe or a steel
crowbar. The sulphur mixes in and that makes
a fire that nothing can stop. It laughs at water.
As for chemical engines, it gives them the roaring
Ha! Ha! When a fire like that burns out it
don&rsquo;t much matter what you had in the beginning;
all you&rsquo;ve got in the end is ashes, and
mighty fine ashes at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny listened to this lecture with intense interest.
When it was over he sat in a brown
study from which he emerged to exclaim:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing queer about it,&rdquo; protested the Chief,
&ldquo;just nature takin&rsquo; her course, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I meant,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;I
meant it was queer that there&rsquo;d be a diamond
merchant&rsquo;s place above a chemist warehouse.
Queer combination, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, queer enough, but you do get some
queer ones. Diamond merchant has his fire insurance,
though, the same as others. Rate would
be high; but low rent probably makes up the
difference. Besides, chemists&rsquo; places are not as
dangerous as they used to be; there are laws
regulating the amount of the dangerous stuff
they may keep in any one place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are inspections frequent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as frequent as they should be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest inspectors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. That doesn&rsquo;t come in my department.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>There the discussion ended, but Johnny pondered
long over that diamond merchant&rsquo;s place
above a chemist&rsquo;s shop. In the end, however, he
forgot it to think of his flat-bottomed boat and
the marsh south of the city. He had promised to
take Mazie out there late this afternoon. She
had listened eagerly to the story of his adventure
out there, and had said she thought the place
must be &ldquo;perfectly bewitching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny was not so sure about that. He had a
wholesome awe of the place since that shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But of course,&rdquo; he had said at last, &ldquo;that
fellow just happened to run across me before I
left the city, and followed me out there. There&rsquo;d
be no danger a second time&mdash;no danger at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So in the end he had promised to go. They
planned to take their lunch along, to arrive
about an hour before sundown and to stay for a
look at the moon rising over the marsh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><br />CHAPTER XII
<br />THE MYSTERY MAN OF THE MARSH</h2>
<p>The moon was just rising out of the marsh;
turning the dark rushes to a deep bottle green
and spreading a bar of gold down a channel. For
two solid hours Johnny had managed to throw
off his problems and worries and the strange
grip of mysteries that had held him so long. In
those two delightful hours he had been just a
boy, paddling about an enchanted marsh in twilight
and gathering darkness.</p>
<p>With his good pal Mazie, he had eaten the
lion&rsquo;s share of a lunch such as only Mazie could
prepare; strangely delicious little sandwiches and
cake that melted in your mouth, pears from a
glass jar, cold chicken, and a thermos bottle of
steaming cocoa. Johnny had enjoyed all this.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>And now, side by side on the narrow seat of
the flat-bottomed boat, they sat through a half
hour of deep enchantment, watching the moon
rise. For a long time they sat in silence, and
who can know what were the long, long
thoughts that came to them?</p>
<p>Whatever they were, they were destined to
come to an abrupt end. Suddenly, as his ear
caught an unaccustomed sound, Johnny put a
finger over Mazie&rsquo;s lips, then stood straight up
to allow his eyes to sweep the marsh. The next
instant he motioned Mazie down as he dropped
flat in the bottom of the boat. For a moment
they lay very still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what is it?&rdquo; Mazie whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s all but inaudible whisper
answered back. &ldquo;Not so loud. Some men can
shoot accurately at sound. It was often done
during the war. I heard the dip of an oar and
caught the gleam of a rifle. It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s the mysterious
one! It must be. Lie perfectly still.
Not a sound. Perhaps he didn&rsquo;t see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I won&rsquo;t move, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>Johnny knew that Mazie was frightened, for
he felt the wild beating of her heart against his
shoulder. But he knew she was game, too, and
was proud of her for that.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes they lay there in the bottom
of the boat. Speaking in the lowest whispers,
scarcely daring to breath, they listened intently,
but caught no further sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Mazie,&rdquo; whispered Johnny at last,
&ldquo;we can&rsquo;t stay here all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you afraid to stay here alone for a
minute or two?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;no. But what are you going to do?&rdquo;
she asked in sudden alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going after that fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny! You&rsquo;ll be killed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll not harm me. It&rsquo;s the only way out.
I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a grip of her hand he signalled farewell,
then with astonishing dexterity he got
over the side of the boat and into the water
without a sound.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>Swimming down the channel until he was
opposite the spot where he judged the man to
have been, he at last began parting the rushes
and making his way slowly through them. He
had not gone ten yards when he caught sight
of a black form directly before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s him!&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in a
boat. There&rsquo;s a channel there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lest he be detected and fired upon, he worked
his way back to his own channel, swam rapidly
up this channel and then crossed the stretch of
rushes to the other side.</p>
<p>For a time after that he swam noiselessly in
the shadow of rushes down the channel toward
the mysterious one&rsquo;s boat, swam until he made
out the form of an oval bottomed, clinker-built
boat. A tall man was standing up in it. Johnny
again caught the gleam of a rifle barrel.</p>
<p>Johnny took one deep, silent breath, then disappeared
under the water.</p>
<p>Swimming strongly under water, he came up
to the right of the boat and almost directly
beneath it. He could hear the man&rsquo;s deep breathing
and caught fragments of husky mutterings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now&rsquo;s the time,&rdquo; Johnny thought to himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>Gripping the edge of the boat he gave it a
sudden upward thrust which all but capsized it.
There followed at once a small splash and a
large one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His rifle goes&mdash;now he takes the plunge,&rdquo;
thought Johnny as his heart went racing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s safe enough now. He&rsquo;ll not find his
rifle at the bottom in this darkness. He&rsquo;s a
tiger without his fangs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny even had the temerity to lift himself
up as high as he could in the water and peer
over the boat.</p>
<p>It was then that he got a real shock. The
man was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! He can&rsquo;t have drowned,&rdquo; Johnny
reasoned.</p>
<p>The next instant a thought struck him which
set him doing the Australian crawl with a
vengeance. The man may have known the general
direction of their boat and might have
gone for it. If he had, what of Mazie?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>After three minutes of breathless swimming,
Johnny arrived in their channel to find his fears
unfounded. Everything was as serene as when
he had left it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he said to Mazie as he climbed
into the boat, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to get out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seizing a long pole, he stood boldly upright
in the boat and sent it shooting through the
water. Ten minutes later he beached his boat,
then dragged it to a low shed which served as
boat-house.</p>
<p>As he turned about from snapping the padlock,
the moon came suddenly out from behind
a cloud and shone down one of those long channels
of the marsh. In the midst of a channel
was a clinker-built boat&mdash;and a man was standing
in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s him,&rdquo; Johnny chuckled, &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m
sort of glad he didn&rsquo;t drown. Bet he hasn&rsquo;t got
his rifle, though. I&rsquo;d like to swim back there
and beat him up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not yield to this mad impulse. Mazie
was pulling at his sleeve and saying in her most
persuasive tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on. Let&rsquo;s go home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; smiled Johnny, slapping the
water from his soaked trousers, &ldquo;guess we&rsquo;d
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know
where that fellow stays and how he always happens
to be about the marsh at the same time
I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something more than a happening,&rdquo;
said Mazie seriously, &ldquo;and since you don&rsquo;t learn
anything by coming, it might be well to stay
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might,&rdquo; agreed Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But for all that,&rdquo; he thought to himself,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going back out there some time and prowl
about the edge of the marsh a bit. That fellow
may live out there somewhere.&rdquo; He thought of
the black shack at the edge of the marsh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; said Mazie as they rode home,
&ldquo;let&rsquo;s go somewhere to-morrow night; some
place where we won&rsquo;t be bothered and where we
can have some fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For instance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not Forest City?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind. Chute the chutes, roll down
the roller coaster, and everything; good old stuff
that never grows old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something like that,&rdquo; smiled Mazie. &ldquo;Anyway,
it&rsquo;s a lot of fun to see people having a
roaring time of it. And they really do enjoy
it. Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;and I might as well
admit it, I enjoy it myself; makes me think of
the picnics and county fairs I used to go to when
I was a small boy. All right, we&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><br />CHAPTER XIII
<br />JOHNNY REPORTS TO THE CHIEF</h2>
<p>&ldquo;How much progress are you making on
your investigation?&rdquo; the Chief asked Johnny
as he came in next morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three suspects and no arrests,&rdquo; smiled
Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the one you gave me&mdash;Knobs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know anything new about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the others? Tell me about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny told of the pink-eyed man and the
tall stooped one who limped. Without thinking
much about it, he told the Chief for the first
time of his visits to the marsh, of his mysterious
assailant out there, and of his fight with
the unknown man on Ben Zook&rsquo;s island.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>The Chief listened intently. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t always
take another&rsquo;s judgment about things, do
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In&mdash;in what way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you I thought that the man who went
out on the breakwater toward that made land
you call Ben Zook&rsquo;s island had been drowned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;yes, that&rsquo;s what you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought he might not have drowned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t drown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t prove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I will. You&rsquo;d know the man if
you saw him again? Or his picture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll prove it, then. Just give me time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the Chief sat wrapped in deep
thought. Then of a sudden he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a rather unusual method of picking
suspects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When the police have a criminal to catch,
a crime to clear up, they go over the list of
criminals who work at such crimes, then they
check up on those persons, possibly shadowing
them for days. But you&mdash;you simply go to a
fire and pick a man who seems particularly interested
in the fire. You say to yourself: &lsquo;He
might be the man.&rsquo; Then you start shadowing
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you see him at three or four fires?
Doesn&rsquo;t that look bad?&rdquo; Johnny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not necessarily. Some persons are just
natural cranks when it comes to fires. They&rsquo;d
get out of bed at midnight to go to one. For
instance, take that pink-eyed fellow you&rsquo;ve been
telling about. It&rsquo;s a well known fact that those
pink-eyed people, albinos they are called, are like
owls; they see best at night. The bright light of
day appears to blind them, so they like to prowl
around at night. This fellow may be that sort
and may have taken up with the running down
of fires as an innocent hobby.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right enough,&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;but on
the other hand some clever gang of criminals
may have noticed his night prowling and may
have induced him to join them in setting blazes.
And besides, these fires are different, aren&rsquo;t
they? Did anyone ever go about the task of
setting fire to all the city&rsquo;s property before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or any other city&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I know of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very special case then, and a special
case requires special methods. When I see a
man at four fires I&rsquo;m going to watch him. And,
believe me, if I ever see one of those two again
I&rsquo;ll have him arrested. And that goes double
for old limpie hooknose! When you see a man
at fire after fire; when you chase him and he
risks his life to escape from you; when someone
very much like him, in a place where you
suspect him of being, leaps out at you and all
but does you in; when someone very like him
twice hunts you in a marsh where you&rsquo;re trying
to enjoy yourself, you can&rsquo;t help but feel that
you&rsquo;re on the right track.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Does sound like there was something in it,&rdquo;
argued the Chief. &ldquo;But, after all, you have
positively identified the man only twice, at the
two fires, and on neither of these occasions was
he doing anything he could be arrested for. If
he were to walk into this room at this very moment
you might take him to jail, but unless he
happened to be carrying damaging evidence on
his person you&rsquo;d have to turn him loose. You
really haven&rsquo;t anything on him&mdash;and you
can&rsquo;t hold an innocent man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ran when we chased him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest people often do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Johnny paused in thought, &ldquo;you
wait. Give me time. I&rsquo;ll bring you something
yet, see if I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That evening as Johnny descended to the
ground floor on his way to keep his appointment
with Mazie, he was surprised to find an
orange wrapper in the box behind the door.
So Ben Zook had remembered the signal!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ben Zook,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;he has something
to tell me. That man has been back on
Ben&rsquo;s island. I must go out there. I wish&mdash;&rdquo;
he paused, irresolute, &ldquo;no, I promised Mazie,
and I won&rsquo;t go back on my word. I&rsquo;ll go out
and see Ben Zook when I come back&mdash;if it&rsquo;s
not too late, and I imagine it&rsquo;s never too late
for him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><br />CHAPTER XIV
<br />JOHNNY&rsquo;S DARK DREAMS</h2>
<p>Forest City was a place of many marvels; at
least so it had seemed to Mazie in the days
when, dressed in rompers, she had come there
to play. The moment you entered the gate
you came in sight of two very merry giants,
reposing upon a carpet of green and dressed
in suits of red and white checkers, six inches to
each checker, each with his head propped upon
an elbow and putting out a red tongue at you.</p>
<p>The giants of course were made of stucco,
and the field they reposed upon was the side of
the building, also made of stucco. That mattered
little. The place was one of enchantment
and the merry giants guarded the pleasant mysteries
of it all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>Immediately behind the giants was a great
room where, for a single thin dime, you might
purchase any number of thrills. You might
try walking through a revolving tank; walking
up a stairway that went down as fast as you
went up; sliding down a wooden chute that had
ten times as many bumps in it as a dromedary
has humps. You might try any number of
things that would set you screaming with delight
or thrilling with sudden and quite groundless
fear.</p>
<p>Nor was this all. There was the skating
rink and the City of Venice where you glided
in slow moving boats amid stately plaster-of-Paris
castles and ancient ruins of the same general
composition. There was the palace of
mirrors; the chute the chutes; the ferris
wheel, and, best and most terrible of all, the
roller coaster, a contrivance that, providing
you had never ridden upon it before, was capable
of crowding a great many thrills into a
short minute of time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>To Mazie and Johnny, who, after all, were
yet quite young, this place had never lost its
charm. They entered into the gayety as wildly
as the rest; at least Johnny had on every other
occasion. This time Mazie found him every
now and again pausing to stand and stare at
the teeming thousands of men, women and
children. He would stare for a full minute,
then with a sudden start would say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, let&rsquo;s go in here,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go over
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last, after leading him to a refreshment
stand where they ordered a cooling drink,
Mazie turned to him with a sudden question:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Johnny slowly.
&ldquo;Mazie, do you believe in premonitions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? Some new religion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s seeing things before they come to
pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s strange. C&rsquo;mon, let&rsquo;s go over
there and sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he exclaimed a moment later as
they sat on a bench, with the throngs marching,
parade-like, past them, &ldquo;There! I saw it
again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like this,&rdquo; he said, mopping his brow.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be walking along here looking at those
faces&mdash;mostly happy faces, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They ought to be happy. This is their play
time and their play place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Johnny, but what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, then of a sudden I see the look on
those faces change. A look of terror comes
upon them. I seem to see them crowding and
crushing, trampling upon one another as they
try in mad despair to escape from something.&rdquo;
Again he mopped his brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Escape from what, Johnny?&rdquo; Mazie whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire,&rdquo; Johnny whispered tensely.</p>
<p>Then, gripping the girl&rsquo;s arm until it hurt, he
fairly hissed: &ldquo;Mazie, I tell you this place is
doomed! I can see it all too plain. It&rsquo;s a premonition,
a warning of the firebug. If only I
knew when and how!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You only dream it,&rdquo; said Mazie. &ldquo;The old
fires and firebugs have got on your nerves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mazie,&rdquo; said Johnny more soberly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
more than that. Perhaps you might call it a
hunch. It&rsquo;s all of that. It&rsquo;s the thing to expect.
That firebug has burned school houses,
a recreation center, the zoo. He seems to be
bent on destroying everything that brings happiness
to people. Why not this place next?
And think what it would mean, Mazie! Think
of ten thousand, maybe twenty or thirty thousand
people, half of them children, gliding in
boats through the City of Venice; children on
the roller coaster and the chute the chutes;
children a hundred feet in air on the Ferris
wheel; board walks thronged with people; and
then, of a sudden, the cry of &lsquo;FIRE! FIRE!&rsquo;
My God, Mazie, think! Think! Mazie, somehow
I must get that man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; said Mazie, &ldquo;are there any people
in the world who hate happiness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty of them, I suppose; enemies of
happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think your firebug is one of
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he isn&rsquo;t, what could be his motive? He
has nothing to gain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; that&rsquo;s right. Most fires that are set
are set for gain. A man secretly moves his insured
stock away, then sets fire to his building,
or hires some firebug to do it, that he
may collect insurance on goods that were not
burned. There is nothing of that in this.
Sometimes revenge is the cause. But what
could one man have against a whole city?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. Our firebug must be an enemy
of happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you have the Chief round up all
such persons? Your firebug might be among
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That might work. I&rsquo;ll suggest it. Those
people, though, are hard to find.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said Johnny after a moment&rsquo;s
thought, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get out of here, it makes me
uncomfortable staying here. I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll see
it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They left the grounds and took a car for
Mazie&rsquo;s house. There, amid the cushions in
Mazie&rsquo;s cozy corner and with a cup of steaming
cocoa before him, Johnny managed to
snatch from this night of unhappy dreams
one little moment of happiness.</p>
<p>After that, having thought of his resolve to
visit Ben Zook yet that night, he rose and bade
Mazie good-night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night, Johnny,&rdquo; she smiled as they
parted, &ldquo;and good luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us hope for it,&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s smile was a
dubious one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><br />CHAPTER XV
<br />BEN ZOOK&rsquo;S DIAMONDS</h2>
<p>In the earlier days of Johnny&rsquo;s experiences
on the Chicago river, he had made many
strange friends. Among them was an old
man who owned a boat, a clumsy but quite
seaworthy craft in which he was accustomed to
paddle about the river and at times even on
the lake. This boat had been kept in a small
brick structure close to the base of a wharf.
The old man had once shown Johnny where he
kept the key and had told him to help himself
to the boat whenever he needed it for a short
trip. He had not seen this old man since his
return to the city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if he&rsquo;s still alive, and if his boat
and the key are still there?&rdquo; he said to himself
as he neared the river. &ldquo;If it is, that&rsquo;s the
surest way to get out to Ben Zook&rsquo;s island.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>A few moments&rsquo; walk brought him to the
spot. The key was there in its old place and,
once the door was open, Johnny found the boat
in its place and in good repair. The grips of
the oars were worn smooth from recent use.
A warm feeling swept over Johnny at this discovery.
In this ever changing world it is
good to discover that an old time friend is still
in the land of the living.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just take you out for a little exercise,&rdquo;
he whispered to the boat as he sent her gliding
into the water.</p>
<p>It was a glorious night for a row. A low-hanging,
golden moon, a lake that was ripply
but not too rough, and balmy night air&mdash;who
could ask for more? Johnny&rsquo;s splendid muscles
relaxed and expanded, expanded and relaxed
with the harmony of a well directed
orchestra.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; he breathed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll soon be there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>He was, too; almost sooner than he wished.
He regretted the necessity of bringing this
grand little trip to an end, but the hour was
late.</p>
<p>Just as he turned to leave the boat a faint
delicious odor smote his nostrils.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hot dog!&rdquo; he exclaimed as he went racing
over the rubbish heaps that lay between the
shore and Ben&rsquo;s cabin.</p>
<p>In his eagerness he forgot that Ben Zook
was not expecting him.</p>
<p>The look of alarm which appeared on the
little old man&rsquo;s face as he sprang to his feet
at sound of footsteps sent a stab of self-reproach
to the boy&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only me, Ben, only Johnny Thompson!&rdquo;
he shouted reassuringly.</p>
<p>The next moment he was shaking the island
hermit&rsquo;s hand and sniffing delightedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hot dog!&rdquo; he said again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep, Johnny, you diagnosed the case. Old
man eatin&rsquo; hot dog this time of night. Ought
to die of indigestion. Draw up a chair and
help yourself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fall over my heatin&rsquo; plant,&rdquo; he
warned as Johnny, taking a step backward,
struck something that gave forth a hollow
sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My heatin&rsquo; plant; goin&rsquo; to be when I get
her installed. Goin&rsquo; to be good&rsquo;n cold out here
this winter. House is too small for a stove.
Goin&rsquo; to be stylish, I am; have a outside hot
water plant. That old tank is good as new.
There&rsquo;s old pipe enough round the dumps to
make my coils and radiation. I&rsquo;ll borrow tools
some day and put her together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; the old man exclaimed as he
helped him to a piping hot frankfurter on a
stick, then settled back in a huge arm chair,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;d be surprised at the things that get
brought out here. This chair now; pretty
nifty, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found her out here. There&rsquo;s about everything
you want out here; bricks, coal, wood,
milk bottles, cookin&rsquo; utensils, three or four
baby buggies an&rsquo; everything else.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And, Johnny,&rdquo; his voice dropped almost to
a whisper, &ldquo;the other day I found something
that looks real valuable. Mebby you&rsquo;ll take
it over town an&rsquo; see. Mebby you would,
Johnny. They wouldn&rsquo;t think nothin&rsquo; of it if
you had it, but if I took it over an&rsquo; it was
the real thing, they&rsquo;d take me by the neck an&rsquo;
say: &lsquo;Ben, you been stealin&rsquo;.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Going back into the back corner of his house,
he loosened a brick in the floor and drew out
a small black velvet case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;t is, Johnny. Saw it stickin&rsquo; out
from the end of a heap of ashes. Wind&rsquo;d
been blowin&rsquo; middlin&rsquo; stiff an&rsquo; had blowed a
lot o&rsquo; fine stuff away so it showed. Open
her up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny started as the lid was lifted. A flash
of light that made the firelight seem dim had
struck his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diamonds,&rdquo; he breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno, Johnny. I thought it might be so.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>Reaching up, Johnny took a small mirror
from the wall. Then, taking a diamond set in
a pin from the case, he drew it across the
glass. There followed a scratching sound. As
he lifted the diamond away he saw a distinct
white line on the glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like the real thing,&rdquo; he said in a low
tone. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be quite sure. And what a
lot of &rsquo;em! This one, a brooch with six; a
lavalliere with four; two ear-rings with one
each; and four loose ones. If they&rsquo;re real,
they&rsquo;re a fortune. Been stolen, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I figured, Johnny. Stole, then
the thief had a hard time to make a clean
getaway. He hides &rsquo;em in a ash can, intendin&rsquo;
to come back for &rsquo;em. The ashman comes
along and away they go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might be right,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll take &rsquo;em over and see about &rsquo;em,
Johnny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to.&rdquo; He put the case in his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have another hot dog, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got my message? The orange
wrapper?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>Johnny nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been at it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who? At what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That big stooped man with a limp. He&rsquo;s
been out here again, standin&rsquo; on the shore close
to the city an&rsquo; shakin&rsquo; his fists an&rsquo; cursin&rsquo;
worse&rsquo;n a pirate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has?&rdquo; Johnny was surprised. &ldquo;What
did you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I tried to get close to him but a
stone rolled under my foot an&rsquo; I guess he heard
me. Anyway, he went lopin&rsquo; off like a antelope,
an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s all I saw of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer he&rsquo;d come back out here,&rdquo; Johnny
mused. Then of a sudden a thought struck
him. Perhaps this man was not a firebug at
all, but a thief. Perhaps this case of diamonds
had not been brought out here in a dump
wagon, but by this strange man. Perhaps he
had hidden it here. Perhaps there were other
cases hidden on the island. He thought of
the diamond merchant&rsquo;s place on Randolph
Street, and of that man Knobs haunting the
same building. What if Knobs and the hooked
nose man with the limp were in a partnership
of crime? Well, at least it was something to
think about.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Johnny,&rdquo; said Ben Zook,
suddenly changing the subject, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to
sort of like this island. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t much account
as it is, all broken bricks and dust, but in
time grass would grow on it&mdash;tall grass that
waves and sort of sighs in the breeze. I&rsquo;d
like it a lot, then, Johnny.&rdquo; Ben&rsquo;s voice grew
earnest &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to own this island; like to
have it always to myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want this island, Ben,&rdquo; said
Johnny quietly. &ldquo;Let me tell you what it&rsquo;s
going to be like, and then I&rsquo;m sure you
wouldn&rsquo;t want it all to yourself. Ben, bye-and-bye
all this rough ground is going to be
smoothed down. The island will be broadened
and fine rich dirt will be hauled on. Grass
will be sown and pretty soon it will all be
green. Trees will be planted and squirrels will
come to live in them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like that, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will probably be a gravel walk winding
in and out among the trees,&rdquo; Johnny continued.
&ldquo;Tired women with little children,
women from those hot cramped flats you know
of in the heart of the city, will come here with
their children. They&rsquo;ll sit on the grass and
let the cool lake breeze fan their cheeks while
their children go frolicking away after the
squirrels or throw crumbs to pigeons and
sparrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be a lagoon between this island
and the shore, a lagoon of smooth, deep water.
There will be boat houses and nice clean-hearted
boys will bring nice girls out here to take them
riding in the boats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And perhaps on a fine Sunday afternoon
there will be a band concert and thousands will
come out to hear it. But you know, Ben, if
you had it all to yourself they couldn&rsquo;t do any
of these things. You don&rsquo;t really want it
now, do you, Ben?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Johnny, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>For a time Ben was thoughtful. When at
last he spoke his voice sounded far away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried never to be selfish, Johnny. Guess
mebby if I&rsquo;d held on to things more, not given
so many fellows that was down and out a boost,
I&rsquo;d have more of my own. That&rsquo;s a fine dream
you got for Ben Zook&rsquo;s island. I&rsquo;d be mighty
proud of it, Johnny. I shore would.&rdquo; Again
he was silent for a long time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;do you see that
path of gold the moon&rsquo;s a paintin&rsquo; on the lake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ben.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sort of reminds me of a notion I had when
I was a boy about the path to Heaven. Foolish
notion, I guess; sort of thought when the time
come you just walked right up there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Foolish notion; but Johnny, here&rsquo;s a sort
of idea I&rsquo;ve worked out settin&rsquo; thinkin&rsquo; here all
by myself. It&rsquo;s a heap of fun to live, Johnny.
I get a lot out of it; it&rsquo;s just like I&rsquo;d never
grown up, like I was just a boy playin&rsquo; round.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And you know, Johnny, when I was a boy
there was a big family of us and we always had
a lot to do. I&rsquo;d be playin&rsquo; with the other boys,
and then suddenly my mother&rsquo;d call:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ben, come here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like that. And I&rsquo;d go, Johnny; always
went straight off, but before I went I&rsquo;d say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, so long, fellers, I got to go now.&rsquo;
I&rsquo;d say it just like that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you know, Johnny, I&rsquo;ve been playin&rsquo;
round most of my life an&rsquo; havin&rsquo; a lot of fun,
even if other folks do call it workin&rsquo;, so when
that last call comes from somewhere way up
above I sort of have a feelin&rsquo; that it&rsquo;ll come
from someone a lot bigger an&rsquo; wiser than me,
just like my mother was when I was a boy.
An&rsquo; I hope I&rsquo;ll be brave enough to say, just as
I used to say then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, good-bye fellers, I got to go now.&rsquo;
Don&rsquo;t you hope so, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so, Ben,&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s voice had grown
husky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo;, Johnny, when my mother called me it
wasn&rsquo;t ever because she felt contrary and
wanted to spoil my fun; it was always because
she had something useful she wanted me to do
for the bunch. I&rsquo;m sort of hopin&rsquo;, Johnny,
when that last call comes it&rsquo;ll be for the same
reason, because the one that&rsquo;s a lot bigger an&rsquo;
wiser than me had got somethin&rsquo; useful he
wants me to do for the bunch of us. Do you
think it&rsquo;ll be that way, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure it will, Ben. But Ben, you&rsquo;re
not very old. That time&rsquo;s a long way off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so, Johnny. It&rsquo;s a grand privilege
to live. But you can&rsquo;t tell, Johnny; you can&rsquo;t,
can you now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a long time after that they sat there in
silence. Johnny was slowly beginning to realize
that he liked this strange little Ben Zook with
his heart of gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Johnny!&rdquo; Ben exclaimed. &ldquo;A fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! Another?&rdquo; cried Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down there by the water front.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny followed his gaze to the south where
there was a great blaze against the sky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; he said after ten seconds of
watching. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t really seem to be on
the shore. Looks as if it were on the far end
of this island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The island, Johnny? What could burn
like that out here? Look at her leap toward
the sky!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, it is. Come on, Ben. We
may learn something. Arm yourself, Ben. It
may mean a fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he said this Johnny picked up a scrap of
gas pipe two feet long. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not forgotten
what you said about striking first and arguing
after,&rdquo; he chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the hand grenades,&rdquo; said Ben,
loading an arm with half bricks.</p>
<p>Thus armed, they hurried away over a rough
path that ran the length of the island.</p>
<p>They had not covered half the distance to
the end when the flare of light began to die
down. It vanished with surprising rapidity.
Scarcely had they gone a dozen paces, after
it began to wane, when the place where it had
been, for lack of that brilliant illumination, appeared
darker than the rest of the island.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What about that?&rdquo; Ben Zook stopped
short in his tracks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on! Come fast!&rdquo; exclaimed Johnny,
determined to arrive at the scene of this strange
spectacle before the last glowing spark had
blinked out.</p>
<p>As he rushed along pell-mell, stumbling over
a brick here, leaping a mound of clay there,
quite heedless of any danger that might surround
him, he might have proven a fair target
for a shot from ambush.</p>
<p>No shot came, and in time he came to a
comparatively level spot of sand in the center
of which there glowed a few coals.</p>
<p>After bending over these for an instant he
scraped away the last remaining sparks with
his bit of gas pipe, then stood there silently
waiting for the thing to cool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; Ben asked as he came up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny drew a flashlight from his pocket
and threw its circle of light on the spot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; whispered Ben, pulling at Johnny&rsquo;s
coat sleeve and pointing toward the lagoon.
Faintly, yet quite distinctly, Johnny heard the
creak of oar locks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A boat,&rdquo; he whispered back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Johnny, they was somebody out here.
And I bet you it was&mdash;that man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The limping man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you suppose was the reason
for the bonfire?&rdquo; Johnny bent over to pick up
a fragment of black cardboard heavily coated
with black paint. This was curved about, forming
the segment of a circle. The inside of the
circle was black and charred like the inside of
a giant firecracker that has been exploded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>Immediately Johnny&rsquo;s mind was rife with
solutions for this fresh mystery. The men
were thieves. They had come to this deserted
spot at night to divide their loot and to burn
any damaging evidence, such as papers, wrappers
and whatever else might be connected with
it. They were smugglers. The flare of light
was a signal to some craft lying far out on the
lake, telling them that all was clear and that
they might run in. Other possible solutions
came to him, but not one of them seemed at
all certain. So, in the end, having pocketed
the one bit of evidence, he walked back with
Ben to his shack. There he promised Ben to
return soon to sit out a watch with him on the
island; then going down to his boat, he pushed
her off.</p>
<p>An hour later he was in his own bed fast
asleep, with Ben Zook&rsquo;s diamonds safe under
his pillows.</p>
<p>His last waking thought had been that if
those were real diamonds there would be a reward
for their return, and that the reward
should go to Ben Zook. It would at least be
a start toward the purchase of his long-dreamed-of
poultry ranch in the country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><br />CHAPTER XVI
<br />THE STRANGE BLACK CYLINDERS</h2>
<p>The forenoon was all but gone when Johnny
stirred in his bed, then sat up abruptly to stare
about him. He had been dreaming, and woven
into the web of his dreams was the face and
figure of his one time fellow adventurer,
Panther Eye, known familiarly as &ldquo;Pant.&rdquo; He
had dreamed of seeing the dark fights and narrow
escapes, and had dreamed of seeing red
lights against a night sky, and blinding white
flares. In his dreams he had again fought a
mountain feud. All this with Pant at his side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish he were here!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed as
he threw back the covers and leaped from his
bed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d put the thing together letter by
letter, word by word, like a cross-word puzzle,
and somehow make a whole of it. The fire at
the school; the pink-eyed stranger; the more
terrible fire that endangered Mazie&rsquo;s life; the
big stooping man with a limp; the fire at the
Zoo; my experience at Ben Zook&rsquo;s island and
at the marsh; for him all these would fit together
somehow. But to me they are little
more than fragments of the sort of stuff life&rsquo;s
made of. Where&rsquo;s the affair to end? I&rsquo;d like
to know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seizing a pen, he wrote a telegram to Pant.
Pant, as you will remember from reading that
other book, &ldquo;The Hidden Trail,&rdquo; had remained
behind to finish a task he had begun in the
Cumberland Mountains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Johnny said to himself after reading
the telegram, &ldquo;he wouldn&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; and he tore
the paper in four pieces and threw it in the
waste basket.</p>
<p>Drawing the fragment of a black cylinder
from his pocket, he studied it carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ought to mean something to me,&rdquo; he
mumbled, &ldquo;but it doesn&rsquo;t; not a thing in the
world.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>From a box in the corner he dragged a desk
telephone, the one he had salvaged from the
Zoo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;would tell a story if only
it could talk. And why can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; He
shook his fist at the instrument. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s a
telephone for if not for talking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since the instrument did not respond, for the
twentieth time Johnny unwound its wires and
sat there staring at them. There was the usual
pair of rather heavily insulated wires and a
second pair of lighter ones, about twenty feet
long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to know what those second wires
are for,&rdquo; he said again, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t. I told
the Chief of Detectives about it, and he laughed
at me and said: &lsquo;Do you think there&rsquo;s someone
with a tongue hot enough to set fire to a
house just by talking over the telephone?
There&rsquo;s some hot ones, but not as hot as that!&rsquo;
He laughed at his own joke, then saw me politely
out of the room, thinking all the time, I don&rsquo;t
doubt, that I was a young nut with a cracked
head. So, old telephone, if your secret is to
be revealed you&rsquo;ll have to tell it, or I&rsquo;ll be
obliged to discover it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>Putting the telephone back in the box, he
took the jewel case from beneath his pillow.
As he saw the jewels in the light of day he
was more sure than ever that they were genuine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;that the Chief of
Detectives will be a trifle more interested in
this than in my telephone, though in my estimation
it&rsquo;s not half as important. But of course
there&rsquo;s sure to be a reward. I mustn&rsquo;t forget
that. It&rsquo;s to be for Ben Zook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief of Detectives was interested, both
interested and surprised. He set his best clerk
working on the record of stolen diamonds. In
less than five minutes the clerk had the record
before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These diamonds,&rdquo; he said, looking hard at
Johnny, &ldquo;were stolen from Barker&rsquo;s on Madison
Street two weeks ago last night. The value
is four thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the reward?&rdquo; said Johnny calmly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much reward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s been said about a reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Good-bye.&rdquo; Calmly pocketing
the case, Johnny started from the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here! Here! Stop that young fool!&rdquo;
stormed the Chief of Detectives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Johnny defiantly, &ldquo;what sort
of cheap piker is this man Barker? It&rsquo;s not
for myself, but for a friend who needs it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about it,&rdquo; said the detective, bending
over and beckoning him close.</p>
<p>Johnny told the story so well that the Chief
got Barker on the wire and pried an even five
hundred dollars out of that tight fisted merchant
before he would promise the return of
the diamonds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll set your friend Zook up in business,&rdquo;
smiled the Chief of Detectives as a half
hour later he handed Johnny a valuable yellow
slip. &ldquo;And say, weren&rsquo;t you in here a day or
two ago with some story about a telephone and
a firebug?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t take much stock in it, did I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bring that back and tell me about it
again. I thought you were a fresh kid and a
bit addled, but by Jove, you&rsquo;ve got a head on
your shoulders and it ain&rsquo;t stuffed with excelsior
above the ears, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do what you say,&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;but
first I&rsquo;d like to run down another hunch if you
don&rsquo;t object.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No objections. Run down as many as you
care to. Bring &rsquo;em all in. Mebby I can help
you, and more&rsquo;n likely you can help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny left the place with a jubilant heart.
He had enough money now to buy Ben Zook
a small ranch. He knew the very place, a
half acre, ten miles from the city limits, a
sloping bank with oak trees on it and a cabin
at its edge, and a touch of green pasture land
with a brook at the bottom. Wouldn&rsquo;t Ben Zook
revel in it? And wouldn&rsquo;t his salvaged poultry
thrive there?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>He wanted to row right out and tell Ben
about it at once. Had he been able to read the
future he would most assuredly have done so,
but since he could only see one step ahead,
and had planned to revisit the marsh and have
a look at that black shack at its edge, in the
end he cashed the check for five hundred and
deposited it in a savings account for safe keeping.
After that he took a train for the marsh.</p>
<p>An hour later, with a feeling of dread that
was not far from fear, and was closely connected
with his startling and mysterious experiences
on two other occasions, he found himself
approaching the black shack.</p>
<p>Since this shack was built on the side of
the marsh nearest to the lake, it was flanked by
low, rolling sand-dunes. This made it easy
for Johnny to approach the shack without being
seen by anyone who might be inside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>After crawling to within fifty feet of it he
lay down behind a low clump of willows, determined
to watch the place for awhile. After
an hour of patient watching, his patience deserted
him. Gripping something firmly in his
hand, he advanced boldly forward until he was
within arm&rsquo;s reach of the building.</p>
<p>There for a time he stood listening. His
footsteps on the sand made no sound. If there
were people in the shack they could not be
aware of his approach.</p>
<p>Nerving himself for quick action and possible
attack, he stepped round the corner to look
quickly in at the window.</p>
<p>Then he laughed softly to himself. There
had been no need for all this precaution. Inside
the shack was but a single room. In that
room there was one person, and that person lay
stretched full length upon a couch with his face
turned toward the wall. To all appearances he
was sound asleep.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Johnny proceeded to make a
calm survey of the room. In one corner stood
a table and chair. On the table were dirty
dishes, an empty can, and a loaf of bread.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>In a back corner stood a rifle, and across
from that some strange looking black cylinders.
It was the cylinders that interested Johnny.
But realizing that he could get a better look
at them from the only other window of the
place, he contented himself, for the moment,
with a careful look at the man. The face could
not be seen, but there was about the large,
heavy frame and rounded shoulders something
vaguely familiar. Still, after all was said and
done, Johnny could not be sure that he had
ever seen the fellow before, and certainly he
did not feel disposed to waken him to find out.</p>
<p>He passed around to the other window and
for a full five minutes studied those black
cylinders. They were strange affairs, about
four inches in diameter and two feet in length.
They resembled huge firecrackers coated black.
Instead of fuse, however, each one had on its
end two small shiny screws such as are found
at the top of a dry battery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably what they are,&rdquo; was Johnny&rsquo;s
mental comment, &ldquo;just big dry batteries.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>Yet he could not quite convince himself that
this was true. In the end, however, he concluded
that was the nearest he could come
to it at a guess, and since a guess was all he
was to get that day, he moved away from the
cabin and was soon lost in the sand dunes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never saw any batteries half that big,&rdquo; he
grumbled to himself as he trudged along, &ldquo;and
besides, what would he be doing with them
out here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he trudged forward for a half mile
in silence. Then, of a sudden he came to a
dead stop, turned about, made as if to retrace
his steps, then appearing to think better of it,
stood there for a moment in deep meditation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be true,&rdquo; he murmured to himself.
&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t seem possible, yet it might be,
and if it is, then the fellow could be miles
away when the thing happens. And if it is
true, then that solves it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then,&rdquo; he added thoughtfully as he resumed
his march toward the station, &ldquo;it seems
altogether too fanciful.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><br />CHAPTER XVII
<br />THE UNANSWERED CALL</h2>
<p>Since there were no new clues to be followed
out, and because he had grown tired of
haunting the central fire station with its incessant
clatter of telegraph instruments and its
eternal flashes of light, at ten o&rsquo;clock that night
Johnny went again to the river and taking his
old friend&rsquo;s boat from its place of concealment
rowed slowly toward Ben Zook&rsquo;s island. The
lake was calm as a millpond and there was no
reason for strenuous rowing. Then, too, he
wished to think as he rowed. Johnny was one
of those fellows who thought best in action.</p>
<p>His thoughts that night were long, long
thoughts, long and tangled. It was as if he
had a half dozen skeins of yarn all tangled
together and was trying to find the ends of
each and to disentangle it from the others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>His mind was still working upon those black
cylinders out in the black shack. He had a
feeling that the man he had seen asleep out
there was none other than the one who had
twice gone gunning for him out there in the
marsh. If that were true and if he were the
man who had been at the Simons Building fire
and at the Zoo and later on Ben Zook&rsquo;s island,
then those black cylinders must have some significance.</p>
<p>He smiled at this complicated chain of circumstances.
&ldquo;Fat chance!&rdquo; he murmured to
himself. &ldquo;And yet that might be true, and if
it is there&rsquo;s some connection between the telephone
with double wiring and that scrap of
black pasteboard we found on the island after
that blaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black pasteboard!&rdquo; he exclaimed suddenly.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! The piece we found is part of
one of those cylinders!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if it is,&rdquo; he said more soberly a moment
later, &ldquo;then why would they burn it out here
on Ben&rsquo;s island? Lot&rsquo;s of sense to that!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>So in the end he got nowhere in his thought
unravelling process. However, his arms were
working mechanically all the time and he was
nearing the island. As he thought of this he
suddenly sat straight up and, as if eager to
reach his goal, began to row with all his power.</p>
<p>He was eager, too, for he suddenly recalled
that he was bound on a very pleasant mission.
Was he not to tell Ben Zook that at any time
he wished he might leave the island for a place
of trees, green grass, flowing water and a real
cabin of fair dimensions? Small wonder that
he hurried.</p>
<p>As he neared the shore his heart warmed at
thought of the smile that would come to the
face of the kindly, cheerful, little old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; he thought to himself, &ldquo;in spite
of the fact that he&rsquo;s a bit strange and uncouth,
he&rsquo;s a real gentleman after all and deserves
a great deal more than is coming to
him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>He smiled as he thought of the little chicken
coop Ben Zook had showed him. A low-roofed
affair with a roost of bars about three feet
long; five chickens on the roost, blinking at
the light; a single goose in a corner with his
head under his wing; this was Ben&rsquo;s poultry
house and his brood. There&rsquo;d be more to it
now&mdash;a real chicken house and perhaps a
hundred fine fowls. It would be a Paradise
for Ben Zook.</p>
<p>As he mused happily on these things his boat
touched the shore. Springing out nimbly, he
dragged the boat up the beach and turned his
face toward Ben&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>At that moment, as a cloud passing over the
moon sent a chill down his spine, something
seemed to whisper to him that all was not well.
That he might dispel this dark foreboding, he
lifted up his voice in a cheery shout:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben Zook! Oh, Ben Zook, I&rsquo;m coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The distant skyscrapers, like some mountainside,
caught his words and flung them back to
him, seeming at the same time to change his
&ldquo;Oh&rdquo; to &ldquo;old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben Zook! Old Ben Zook!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>Again and again, more faintly, and yet more
faintly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben Zook! Old Ben Zook. Ben Zook&mdash;Zook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the echo trailed away in the distance, a
foreboding came over Johnny. There had come
no answering call.</p>
<p>Still he tried to cheer himself. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s asleep,&rdquo;
Johnny told himself. &ldquo;Little wonder, too. I
was out here till near morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that he trudged in silence over the
piles of broken brick, sand and clay.</p>
<p>As he came at last within sight of Ben&rsquo;s
place he was cheered by the sight of red coals
on the grate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not been long since he was here, anyway,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>Yet his feeling that Ben was not in his house
proved true. The place was empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably gone for a stroll down the beach,&rdquo;
was his mental comment as he dropped down in
Ben&rsquo;s big arm chair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>The chair was a comfortable one. The fire,
with a chill breeze blowing off the lake, was
cheering too, yet there was no comfort for
Johnny. He had not been seated two minutes
when he was again upon his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>The next moment he was chiding himself
for a fool. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be here in a moment and I&rsquo;ll
tell him about the reward.&rdquo; Johnny smiled at
the thought.</p>
<p>Walking to the tiny poultry house, he opened
the door and, flicking on his flashlight, looked
within. The calm assurance of chickens on
their roost, of the single goose who did not so
much as take his head from beneath his wing,
did much to allay his fears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just look about a bit, anyway,&rdquo; he mused.
&ldquo;May find another case of diamonds,&rdquo; he added
with a forced chuckle.</p>
<p>As he stepped over the first mound of clay
he thought he detected a sound behind him.
Stopping dead in his tracks, while little tufts
of hair appeared to rise at the back of his neck,
he said in a low, steady tone:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ben. Ben Zook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There came no answer, no other sound.</p>
<p>He crossed another mound, and yet another.
Then again there came a sound as of a brick
loosened from a pile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben. Ben Zook,&rdquo; he called softly. Once
more no answer.</p>
<p>Then, just as he was about to go forward
again, having thrown his light ten feet before
him, he started back in horror. There at his
feet lay a dead man!</p>
<p>Trembling in every limb, feeling sick as if
about to fall in a faint, yet battling it back,
he stood still in his tracks for such a space of
time as it might take to count one hundred.</p>
<p>Then, finding he could once more trust his
wobbly knees, he moved forward three paces,
threw his light at his feet, took one good steady
look, put out a hand and picked something up,
held it for ten seconds, bent low for a better
look, then like one who had seen a ghost he
went racing and staggering across the piles toward
the shore and his boat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>Fear lent him wings. Nor did he stop at the
shore. With one motion he shoved the boat
into the water; with another, regardless of wet
feet, he sprang aboard and before he could
think twice found himself well out into the
lake.</p>
<p>There at last he dropped his oars to sit
staring back at the island and to at last slump
down in his seat.</p>
<p>His mind, first in a whirl and next in a dead
calm, was trying to tell his senses something
that seemed impossible.</p>
<p>At last, raising his face to the sky, he said
solemnly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben Zook is dead! Poor, harmless, golden
hearted Ben Zook! Someone killed him. I&rsquo;m
going after the police boat now. The police
will do what they can to find the man. But,
by all that&rsquo;s good, I will find the murderer
and he will pay the price for his cowardly
crime.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>Having thus made his vow, he found that
strength, hope and courage came ebbing back.
Seizing his oars he rowed rapidly toward the
city.</p>
<p>From that time until the end Johnny conducted
his search with such reckless daring
that it could bring but one of two things: A
crown of triumph or a quiet six feet of sod in
a church-yard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><br />CHAPTER XVIII
<br />THE RETURN OF PANTHER EYE</h2>
<p>After accompanying the police boat to the
island and having watched in silence the investigation
made by the police, which was followed
by a short search for the man who had visited
the island with such tragic results, Johnny returned
at once to the city and there made
straight toward the river bridge.</p>
<p>Imagine his surprise when, upon setting foot
on the bridge, he discovered light shining
through the crack left by the closed shutters
of his window.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Waiting for me,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Wonder
which of them it is? Well, let them wait,&rdquo;
he added fiercely, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so defenseless as
I might seem.&rdquo; He put a hand to his side
pocket. A friendly policeman, finding Johnny
unarmed as they searched the island, had
pressed a small automatic upon him and had
forgotten to take it back. Johnny was now
thankful for the oversight.</p>
<p>Without a second&rsquo;s hesitation, but keeping
a sharp lookout that he might not be ambushed
by some guard stationed outside, he crossed the
bridge, dodged down a narrow alley and having
reached the ground floor door that led to
the back stairs, paused to listen.</p>
<p>Having heard no sound, he pushed open the
door, closed it noiselessly behind him, then went
tip-toeing softly up the steps. At the second
landing he paused to listen, yet he heard no
sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; he whispered as he resumed
his upward climb.</p>
<p>As he reached his own door he recalled an
old copy-book axiom: &ldquo;Delays are dangerous.&rdquo;
So, gripping his automatic with one hand, he
turned the knob with the other and threw the
door wide open.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>Imagine his surprise at seeing a single figure
slumped down in a chair, apparently fast
asleep.</p>
<p>The person had his back to him. There
was something vaguely familiar about that back.
Slowly a smile of pleasant anticipation spread
over Johnny&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it only were,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>Tip-toeing to a position which gave him a
side view of the still motionless figure, he
stared for a second, then there came upon his
face an unmistakable smile as he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pant! You old trump you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was indeed Pant, the Panther Eye you
have known for some time, that strange boy
who had accomplished so many seemingly impossible
things through his power to see in the
night and to perform other magical tricks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s you!&rdquo; said Pant, waking up
and dragging off his heavy glasses to have a
good look at Johnny. &ldquo;I figured you&rsquo;d be
back sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pant,&rdquo; said Johnny, lowering himself unsteadily
into a chair, &ldquo;there was never a time
in all my checkered career when I was so glad
to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be in pretty deep,&rdquo; grinned
Pant, &ldquo;&lsquo;powerful deep,&rsquo; they&rsquo;d say in the
mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Pant, what happened?&rdquo; asked Johnny.
&ldquo;How does it come you left the mountains so
soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pant put on a sad face. &ldquo;Those mountain
people are superstitious, Johnny, terribly superstitious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they? Why look, Johnny, we were
having a school election down there, regular
kind. Everybody wanted his sister or his cousin
or his daughter in as teacher. We were about
evenly divided and were fighting it out fair
enough with the great American institution,
the ballot, when an argument came up in which
Harrison Crider, their clerk of election, knocked
Cal Nolon out of his chair. Right there is
where things began to start. There were fifteen
or twenty on a side, all armed and all packed
in one room twenty feet square. You can see
what it was going to be like, Johnny.&rdquo; Pant
paused to go through the motion of mopping
his brow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They were all standing there loaded and
charged, like bits of steel on the end of a magnet,
when a strange thing happened.&rdquo; He
paused to stare at the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; asked Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, it was one of those queer things,
&lsquo;plumb quare,&rsquo; they&rsquo;d call it down in the mountains,
one of those things you can&rsquo;t explain&mdash;at
least most people can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what did happen?&rdquo; Johnny demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m coming to,&rdquo; drawled Pant.
&ldquo;Well, sir, believe me or not, there came such
a brilliant flash of light as was never before
seen on sea or land (at least that&rsquo;s what they
all say. I didn&rsquo;t see it; had my eyes shut tight
all the time). And after that, so they say,
there was darkness, a darkness so black you
couldn&rsquo;t see your hand. &lsquo;Egyptian darkness,&rsquo;
that&rsquo;s what they called it, Johnny. You&rsquo;ve
heard of that. It tells about it in the Bible,
the plague of darkness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It only lasted three minutes; but would
you believe it, Johnny, when the three minutes
were up there wasn&rsquo;t a bit of fight left in
them? No sir, limp as rags, every man of &rsquo;em.
And the election after that was as calm and
sedate as a Quaker sewing society.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Johnny,&rdquo; Pant&rsquo;s face took on a sad
expression, &ldquo;would you believe it? After it
was all over those superstitious people accused
me of the whole affair; said I was a witch and
that I produced that darkness by incantation.
Now Johnny, I leave it to you, was that fair?
Would you think that of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Pant,&rdquo; said Johnny with a grin, &ldquo;I
wouldn&rsquo;t. I know you&rsquo;re no witch, and I know
any incantation you might indulge in wouldn&rsquo;t
get you a thing. But as for creating that darkness,
I&rsquo;d say it was a slight trick compared
with others I&rsquo;ve seen you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Johnny,&rdquo; sighed Pant, &ldquo;I can see the
whole world&rsquo;s against me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But Johnny!&rdquo; he exclaimed, changing suddenly
from his attitude of mock gloom to one
of alert interest, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the lay? To tell
the honest truth, I&rsquo;ve been bored to death down
there. I knew if I could find you I&rsquo;d be able
to mix in with something active. So here I
am. What have you to offer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty!&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;And, thank God,
you&rsquo;re here to take a hand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><br />CHAPTER XIX
<br />A DEN OF THE UNDERWORLD</h2>
<p>After dragging the Zoo telephone from its
box and taking the scrap of black cardboard
from a shelf, Johnny sat down to tell his
story. He told it, too, from beginning to end;
from the school fire to the discovery of Ben
Zook, dead upon his island.</p>
<p>When the story had ended Pant sat for a
long time slumped down in his chair. From
his motionless attitude and his staring eyes,
one might have thought him in a trance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>He came out of this with a start and at once
began to reel off to Johnny the story he had
just been told; only now there was association,
connection, and a proper sequence to it all. He
had put the puzzle together, piece by piece.
No, it was more than that. The fires were one
puzzle; Johnny&rsquo;s affairs at the island another;
and those at the marsh still another. After
solving each of these separately and putting
each small part in its place, Pant had joined
them all in one three-fold puzzle board that
was complete to the last letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds great!&rdquo; said Johnny breathlessly as
Pant concluded. &ldquo;If all that is true we have
only to find the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Find that man!&rdquo; said Pant in a tone that
carried conviction.</p>
<p>Twelve o&rsquo;clock the following night found
Johnny and Pant in a strange place. Standing
with their backs against the unpainted and decaying
side of a frame building, they were
watching a door.</p>
<p>The frame building formed one wall to an
alley which was in reality more path than an
alley; a path of hard-beaten mud that ran between
two buildings. Although the path ran
through from street to street, the hard beaten
part of the path ended before the door which
the two boys were watching.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes another,&rdquo; Pant whispered,
drawing Johnny back into the shadows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And another,&rdquo; Johnny whispered back.</p>
<p>Two shadow-like creatures, appearing to hug
the darkness, came flitting down the hard-trodden
path. As each reached the end of the
path the door opened slightly, the shadows
flitted in, and again the door went dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like shades of evil ones entering their last,
dark abode,&rdquo; whispered Johnny with a shudder.</p>
<p>They were watching that door because they
had seen a certain man enter it&mdash;a tall, stooping,
slouching figure of a man who walked
with a decided limp. They had picked up his
trail in a more prosperous neighborhood and
had followed him at a distance through less
and less desirable neighborhoods, down dark
streets and rubbish strewn alleys, past barking
dogs and beggars sleeping beneath doorsteps,
until of a sudden he had turned up this path
and entered this door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; Johnny whispered impatiently,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s only a cheap eating place. I heard the
dishes rattle and caught the aroma of coffee.
They&rsquo;ll pay no attention to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure of that,&rdquo; Pant grumbled.
&ldquo;Looks like something else to me. But&mdash;all
right, come on. Only,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;take a
table near the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The place did prove to be some sort of eating
place. There were small round tables and
steel framed chairs placed about the room.
Around some of these tables men and women
were seated, playing cards. Openly roaring at
good fortune or cursing an evil turn of the
deck, they paid no attention whatever to the
newcomers.</p>
<p>The card players were for the most part situated
in the back of the room. Tables at the
front were covered with dishes. Men and
women, engaged in eating, smoking and talking,
swarmed about these tables.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>Indeed, the place was so crowded that for a
time Johnny and Pant were at great difficulty
to find chairs. At last, as they were backing
to a place against the wall, a small animated
being, a slender girl with dark, vivacious eyes,
rose and beckoned them to her table. She had
been sitting there alone sipping dark coffee.</p>
<p>Bowing his thanks, Johnny accepted a chair
and motioned Pant to another. The table was
not as near the door as he might have liked,
but &ldquo;beggars cannot be choosers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A waiter appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coffee and something hot in a bowl,&rdquo; said
Johnny. &ldquo;You know the kind, red Mex. with
plenty of pepper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it the same,&rdquo; said Pant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And waiter,&rdquo; Johnny put out a hand,
&ldquo;something nice for her,&rdquo; he nodded his head
toward the girl. &ldquo;Anything she&rsquo;d like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gentlemen are kind,&rdquo; said the girl in a
foreign accent, &ldquo;but I have no need. I will
have none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since their new-found friend did not accept
of their hospitality and did not start a conversation,
the two boys sat silently staring about
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>It was a strange and motley throng that was
gathered there. Dark Italians and Greeks; a
few Irish faces; some Americans; two Mexicans
in broad sombreros; three mulatto girls at
a table by themselves and a great number of
men and women of uncertain nationality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! There he is,&rdquo; whispered Johnny,
casting his eyes at the far corner. &ldquo;And
there, by all that&rsquo;s good, is Knobs, the New
York firebug! They&rsquo;re at the same table. See!
I can&rsquo;t be mistaken. There&rsquo;s the same hooked
nose, the identical stoop to his shoulders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Together!&rdquo; exclaimed Pant. &ldquo;That changes
my conclusions a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t appear to see them,&rdquo; whispered
Johnny. &ldquo;What are we to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Perhaps a police raid. But
not yet; I want to study them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their bowls of steaming red Mulligan had
arrived. They had paid their checks and had
begun to sip the fiery stuff, when of a sudden
there came cries of &ldquo;Jensie! Jensie!&rdquo; and
every eye was turned in their direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>Johnny felt his face suddenly grow hot.
Had he been recognized? This beyond doubt
was a den of the underworld. Was this a cry
which was but a signal for a &ldquo;Rush the bulls&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Since he could not tell, and since everyone
remained in his seat, he did not move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the gentlemen will please hold their
bowls,&rdquo; said the girl, smiling as she handed
each his bowl.</p>
<p>What did this mean? They were soon to
see. Stepping with a fairy-like lightness from
floor to chair, and chair to table, the girl made
a low bow and then as a piano in a corner
struck up a lively air she began a dance on
the table top.</p>
<p>It was such a wild, whirling dance as neither
of the boys had seen before. It seemed incredible
that the whole affair could be performed
upon so small a table top. Indeed, at
one time Johnny did feel a slight pat upon his
knee and realized in a vague sort of way that
the velvet slippered foot of this little enchantress
had rested there for an instant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>No greater misfortune could have befallen
the two boys than this being seated by the
dancer&rsquo;s table. It focussed all eyes upon them.
Their detection was inevitable. They expected
it. But, coming sooner than they could dream,
it caught them unawares. With a suddenness
that was terrible, at the end of the applause
that followed the girl&rsquo;s performance, there came
a death-like pause, broken by a single hissed-out
word.</p>
<p>The next instant a huge man with a great
knife gleaming in his hand launched himself
at Pant.</p>
<p>Taken entirely unawares, the boy must have
been stabbed through and through had it not
been for a curious interference. The man&rsquo;s
arm, struck by a sudden weight, shot downward
to drive the knife into the floor.</p>
<p>The next instant, as a tremendous uproar
began, there came a sudden and terrible flash
of light followed by darkness black as ink.</p>
<p>Johnny, having struggled to his feet, was
groping blindly about him when a hand gripped
his shoulder and a voice whispered:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This way out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the same moment he felt a tug at the
back of his coat.</p>
<p>Moving forward slowly, led by Pant and being
tugged at from behind, he at last came to
the door and ten seconds later found himself
in the outer semi-darkness of the street.</p>
<p>Feeling the tug at his coat lessening, he
turned about to see Jensie, the dancing girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know that she saved your life?&rdquo;
he whispered to Pant. &ldquo;She leaped squarely
upon that big villain&rsquo;s arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rode it like I might a mule,&rdquo; laughed the
girl. &ldquo;And you, Mister,&rdquo; she turned to Pant,
&ldquo;you are a Devil. You make a terrible light,
you then make terrible night. You are a wonderful
Devil!&rdquo; and with a flash of her white
teeth she was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what?&rdquo; asked Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We cannot do better than to follow. They
will be out at us like a pack of rats in another
minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about a police raid?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-night. It wouldn&rsquo;t do any good.
The birds have flown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this Pant led the way rapidly out of the
narrow alley into more frequented and safer
ways.</p>
<p>Little did Johnny dream as he crept beneath
the covers that night that the following night
would see the end of all this little drama in
which he had been playing a part. Yet so it
was to be.</p>
<p>As for Pant, who slept upon a cot in one
corner of Johnny&rsquo;s room, he was dreaming of
a slender figure and of big, dark, Gypsy eyes.
He was indulging in romantic thoughts&mdash;the
first of his life. That Gypsy-like girl of the
underworld den had somehow taken possession
of his thoughts. Many times before had he
barely escaped death, but never before had his
life been saved by a girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a Gypsy,&rdquo; he whispered to himself,
&ldquo;only a Gypsy girl. But me; who am I? Who
knows? Perhaps I am Gypsy myself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>Through his mind there passed a wish that
was more than half prayer: &ldquo;May the time
come when I can repay her.&rdquo; This wish was
to be granted, far sooner than he knew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><br />CHAPTER XX
<br />JOHNNY STRIKES FIRST</h2>
<p>At a quarter of six next evening, at the request
of the Fire Chief, Johnny was lurking
in the shadows back of the building on Randolph
Street that housed such a strange collection
of commodities: chemicals, diamonds, juvenile
books, novelties and Knobs, the suspected
firebug.</p>
<p>Earlier that day a phone call had tipped off
the Chief. According to the call, Knobs Whittaker
would bear a little extra watching that
night. While putting little faith in this tip, the
Chief had no desire to neglect the least clue
which might assist in bringing to an end the
series of disastrous fires which were reflecting
great discredit upon his department. Acting
upon the tip he had stationed men at every
point which Knobs had been seen to frequent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s station was this building. He had
come around behind to have a look at possible
exits there. Having satisfied his mind in this
matter, he was about to make his way back
along the wall to the street when he was halted
by the sudden sound of a truck entering the
alley.</p>
<p>Slinking deeper into the shadows, he waited.
To his surprise he saw the truck back up at
the door of the very building he was watching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to take something away,&rdquo; was his
mental comment.</p>
<p>This thought was at once abandoned when
he noted that the light truck was already
loaded to capacity.</p>
<p>Climbing down from the seat, the driver and
his assistant walked to the door. Finding it
locked, the driver beat a tattoo on it with his
fist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wanted?&rdquo; demanded a voice as a
head was thrust out of a window to the left of
the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Open up!&rdquo; growled the driver. &ldquo;Got a
consignment of chemicals for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you coming round this time of day
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Came all the way from Calumet. Had a
blow-out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one here but me,&rdquo; said the
young man, reluctantly unbarring the door.
&ldquo;Boss is gone. Chief clerk&rsquo;s gone. His assistant
is gone. I&rsquo;m only a sort of apprentice.
Haven&rsquo;t any authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we can&rsquo;t dump the goods in the street,
can we? It&rsquo;s going to rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I suppose you can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the young
man, scratching his head doubtfully. &ldquo;Suppose
you&rsquo;ll have to dump them in here until morning.
You&rsquo;ll have to come round then and check
up on them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s jake with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The apprentice began clearing a space at the
back of the shop. The carters tumbled off
bags and boxes, to pile them in the cleared
space. After this had been done the steel night
doors were closed and the truck drove away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They drive as if the devil were after
them,&rdquo; thought Johnny.</p>
<p>Without quite knowing why, he lingered for
a time back there in the deepening shadows
and as he lingered he caught an unusual sound
from one of the rooms above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s odd, sounds like something heavy
being rolled over the floor; a piano, or&mdash;or
maybe a safe. Wonder why anyone would be
doing that this time of the day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As it had grown quite dark by this time, he
moved around to the front.</p>
<p>From the moment the matter had been called
to his attention, this building with its strange
assortment of occupants had held a profound
interest for Johnny. He suspected Knobs of
holding an interest in the Novelty Company,
in truth suspected that floor of being his hangout.
He was more than interested in the
diamond merchant&rsquo;s place, too. Indeed, he felt
that somehow there must be a connection between
Knobs and the diamonds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he means to steal them?&rdquo; he told
himself now as he lingered in the shadow of
the building. &ldquo;But then, there are the burglar
alarms. How is he to get around them? Well,
we&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An eddy of air sweeping up the street showered
him with dust and paper scraps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh,&rdquo; he grunted, as he made for the door
of the building to escape this little whirlwind,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re in for a blow; perhaps rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fiddle!&rdquo; he exclaimed a moment later, &ldquo;I
promised to go to Forest City with Mazie to-night.
Carnival! Last of the season. Told
her I&rsquo;d do it if nothing turned up. But something
has turned up, at least the Chief thinks
it&rsquo;s going to turn up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And just then things did turn up; at least
one thing did, and not so small either. Treading
on air, as if afraid of disturbing the spirit
of his dead grandmother, there came tripping
down the stair no less a person than Knobs
Whittaker!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Put &rsquo;em to sleep with a brick and argue
with &rsquo;em afterwards,&rdquo; Johnny seemed to be
hearing poor old Ben Zook saying.</p>
<p>Knobs was carrying a square black satchel
in his hand. His right hip bulged. He did
not see Johnny, who stood well back in the
shadows. Just as his feet touched the ground
floor, as if drawn by a rocket, Knobs shot
straight up from the floor to at last topple over
in a heap. Johnny&rsquo;s good right hand had
spoken. He had obeyed the instructions of old
Ben Zook.</p>
<p>Knobs&rsquo; sleep lasted for scarcely more than
ten seconds; long enough, however, for Johnny
to explore his hip pocket and draw forth an
ugly-looking blue automatic. When Knobs
opened his eyes he looked into the muzzle of
his own gun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>The art of escape is sometimes cultivated to
such a degree of perfection that it becomes
automatic. The street door was open. With
a motion that could scarcely be called rolling,
leaping or gliding, the prostrate man went
through that door. Before Johnny could block
his escape, or even press the trigger of the
automatic, Knobs was gone. One thing was
against the fleeing one, however; he had left
his gun and his black case behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evidence here,&rdquo; Johnny whispered to himself.
&ldquo;Valuable evidence, beyond a doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, following a rule he had laid down for
himself: &ldquo;Always do the thing that&rsquo;s least
expected,&rdquo; instead of following the man, he
picked up the black bag and sprang lightly up
the stairs and out of sight. He did not stop
at the first landing, nor the second; but continued
to the third, where, after hurrying down
the hall, he threw back the iron shutters of the
hall window, tossed the bag out, and jumped
to the flat roof below. After that he lost no
time in making his way down a fire escape to
the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>After a hasty glance up and down the alley,
he gripped the handle of Knobs&rsquo; automatic with
his right hand, and carrying the black bag in
his left, walked with a leisurely and nonchalant
air down the alley and out on the side street.
To all appearances the street was deserted.
Apparently no one had seen him emerge from
the alley. He was thankful for that.</p>
<p>Hardly had he walked a dozen paces on that
street when there struck his ears a cry that
had grown familiar:</p>
<p>&ldquo;FIRE! FIRE! FIRE!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;I wonder
where now?&rdquo; He was to know soon enough.</p>
<p>There is something strange about a city
street. Though it be deserted from end to end,
let one cry of &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; ring out upon its deserted
stillness, and within the space of thirty
seconds it is thronging with people. It was
so now. In a moment the place was swarming
with people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>Johnny Thompson did not join the throng.
He was far too wise for that. The black bag
he carried contained something of vital interest
to that smooth villain, Knobs. Knobs would
want it back. Nor would he be alone. There
might be twenty of his gang in that crowd.
For them to surround Johnny and beat him up
in such a mob would be a simple enough matter.
He would leave no chance for that. Turning,
Johnny sped down an alley, crossed a street,
shot down a second alley and, reaching the
river, he raced along the wall that lined its
banks, climbed the bridge, then to the back of
a building, paused once more to listen, then
climbed the stairs to his room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shook them!&rdquo; he puffed as he bolted the
door and carefully placed the black bag under
the bed.</p>
<p>His next move was to throw back the steel
blinds to his own windows and to look in the
direction of that building on Randolph Street
that he had just left.</p>
<p>The sight that met his eyes brought an exclamation
to his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pant!&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;Pant! Wake up! If
you want to see a fire that is one, come here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tumbling from the cot where he had been
sleeping, Pant stumbled toward the window.
Then he, too, stared in wonder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Talk about quick burners!&rdquo; exclaimed
Johnny. &ldquo;Did you ever see anything quicker
or hotter than that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Pant solemnly, &ldquo;I never have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The building, filled with chemicals, diamonds,
books and novelties, was a white hot furnace.
Johnny had seen blast furnaces, open hearths,
and the white flames of the Bessemer, but never
had he seen a fiercer, hotter flame than this
one. Even at this great distance it seemed to
fairly scorch his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough chemicals in that place to stock
an army for the next war,&rdquo; he said aloud.</p>
<p>At once he thought of the truck load of
chemicals that had arrived at a quarter of six,
and of the heavy rolling sound he had heard
shortly after the truck drove away.</p>
<p>Never in all the history of Chicago had there
been a hotter fire. Johnny could see the firemen,
forced from one position to another, fall
back, back, and back again. They made no attempt
to quench this white fury. The best
they could do was to throw a water screen
against the buildings next to this to prevent
disaster from spreading to the entire business
district.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh man!&rdquo; exclaimed Pant. &ldquo;Only look!
Red flames, white flames, purple, yellow and
blue. Must have burned its way through the
crust of the earth and turned the thing into a
volcano.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chemicals,&rdquo; said Johnny. He had been
looking for an explosion; such an explosion as
would wreck every building in the block and
perhaps cross the river and shake bricks down
upon his own head. But as the moments passed,
he began to hope that it would not come. When
a quarter of an hour had worn itself slowly
away and the fierce flames began to die down,
he knew that it would not come, and breathed
a prayer of thankfulness for that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pant, I promised Mazie and that little girl
we saved from the school fire that we&rsquo;d go out
to Forest City to-night. This is the last night
of the Carnival. It&rsquo;s not too late yet. There&rsquo;s
nothing I can do about that fire over there until
it has cooled down. Want to go?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; said Pant. &ldquo;In fact, I&rsquo;d
rather like to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Throw on your glad rags and
come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little later, as Johnny locked the door on
the outside, he hesitated for a moment. He
had thought of the black bag he had thrown
under the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safe there as anywhere in the world,&rdquo; he
told himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll break the lock and look inside
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he followed Pant down the stairs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><br />CHAPTER XXI
<br />A TRIP TO FOREST CITY</h2>
<p>As the elevated train rattled noisily along
over the low roofs of cottages and between
endless rows of apartment houses, Johnny
Thompson sat staring dreamily at the lattice-like
covering of the floor of his car.</p>
<p>He was allowing the events of the past few
days to move before his mind&rsquo;s eye. It seemed
much like a moving picture. There was a scene
showing the central fire station with its leaping
yellow lights. A click, a flash, and there was
a fire, a city school building burning, a pink-eyed
man, a child in the school loft, a tall
ladder, he ascended, descended, then searched
for the pink-eyed man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>A second flash of light, a second fire; this
time the great Simons Building, and Mazie in
a tenth-story window. There was the fireman&rsquo;s
monkey, and again the pink-eyed man, also for
the first time the man of the hooked nose, the
stoop and limp.</p>
<p>Once more a flash of white film: a boat in
a marsh, black birds and a mysterious rifle shot.</p>
<p>A third fire, the Zoo. A wild chase ending
at the breakwater, and after that a fight on
the island and little old Ben Zook.</p>
<p>Then again the marsh, a boat and Mazie,
and after that the mysterious assailant. Then
came that tragic scene, the death of poor, old
Ben Zook.</p>
<p>The den of the underworld, the dancing girl,
Jensie; the attack, Pant&rsquo;s life saved by the girl,
the mysterious light, mystifying darkness, then
the outer air.</p>
<p>The building on Randolph Street, the mysterious
load of chemicals, the fight with Knobs
Whittaker. Flight. The fire that seemed hotter
than the flames of a volcano.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And here we are,&rdquo; he whispered to himself.
&ldquo;How does it all connect up? Or does it?
Sometimes it seems to; at others it appears not
to. How is it all to end?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pant suddenly interrupted his reveries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;men don&rsquo;t know much
about light, do they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose not, Pant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course they don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s all sort of relative,
isn&rsquo;t it? If I have a torch in a dark room
it seems a brilliant light. Take it into the sunlight
and it dwindles to nothing. Now if an
extraordinarily bright light struck your eyes for
a second and the next second vanished, the
lights of a room might seem no light at all,
just plain darkness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; said Johnny, without really thinking
much about it.</p>
<p>Since this was the last great night of the
greatest carnival ever held in the city&rsquo;s most
popular pleasure resort, though the hour was
late, the cares were here and there given bits
of color by the costumes of pleasure-seeking
revelers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>The journey was scarcely more than half
completed when the car filled, and Pant felt
compelled to give his seat to a slender girl who,
like himself, was headed for the scene of gaiety.
Dressed as a Gypsy, with red shoes, red stockings,
a bright colored striped dress and a
crimson shawl, with a mask completely covering
her face, she would have been difficult to
recognize even by her most intimate acquaintances.
But the keen eye of this unusual boy,
Pant, detected something vaguely familiar.
Mayhap it was the slender, red stockinged
ankles, or the constantly bobbing feet that suggested
a dance, or the long, artistic fingers that
constantly plaited her dress.</p>
<p>He studied her until they left the car. As
he turned to leave at Mazie&rsquo;s station, he felt a
sudden tickle above his collar. Turning quickly,
he surprised the Gypsy girl concealing the colored
end of a feathery reed beneath her cloak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah there,&rdquo; he breathed, &ldquo;I thought I knew
you. Here&rsquo;s hoping I see you at Forest City.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>Quick as thought the girl&rsquo;s fingers went to
her belt, then to the bosom of her dress. She
snipped a small red rose from a bouquet at her
belt and pinned it to her dress.</p>
<p>The next instant Johnny gave Pant such a
pull as drew him half down the car. Two
seconds later they were on the platform and
the car was speeding away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was holding you?&rdquo; demanded Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Gypsy girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I recognized her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! You did?&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;Well,
come on, we go down here. It&rsquo;s late. Mazie
and the little girl may not wait. Let&rsquo;s hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mazie and Tillie McFadden had waited.
Since the amusement park was only six blocks
from Mazie&rsquo;s home, they walked. In a short
time they were mingling with the fun-mad
throng that flowed like a many colored stream
down the board walks of Forest City, a city
which Johnny had once said was doomed. As
he entered it now he asked himself whether
this were true. The answer was: Who knows?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>The mingled sounds that strike one&rsquo;s ears on
a night like this are stunning in their variety
and intensity. The dull tom-tom of some Gypsy
fortune teller inviting trade by pounding a flat-headed
drum; the steady challenge of men who
invite you to risk your small change on the turn
of a spindle wheel; the inviting shout of hawkers;
the high-pitched screams descending from
the roller coaster as a car pitches down through
space; the minor shouts of revelers on the
board walks; all this, blended with the dull
rumble of wheels, the clank of machinery, the
splash of boats, the murmur of ten thousand
voices, produces a sound which in the aggregate
blends into a mad jumble that leaves one with
no conscious thought of sound. No one sound
seems to register above the others. It is all
just one great <i>noise</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>The sights that strike your eye are scarcely
less impressive. Great streamers of confetti,
red, white, blue, yellow and green tissue ribbons
hanging from wires, from plaster-of-paris
domes, from windows, from electric lights, from
every spot where a sparrow might rest his
wings; bushels of bits of paper flying through
the air like a highly tinted snow storm; and
the amusements&mdash;here a car rushing through
space, there the whirling invitation of an airplane,
and there again the slow and stately
Ferris wheel. Beneath all this the colorful
throng that, like some giant reptile, moves
ever forward but never comes to an end. These
were the sights that thrilled the four young
pleasure seekers.</p>
<p>The sensations of touch, too, added to the
frenzy that appeared to enter one&rsquo;s very veins
and to send his blood racing. A wild group
of revelers, playing a game that is little less
than crack-the-whip, wrap themselves about you,
to at last break up like a wave of the sea
and go surging away. A single frenzied reveler
seizes you sharply by the arm, to scream at
you and vanish. A tickler touches your ear;
a handful of fine confetti sifts down your neck;
you are caught in a swelling current of the
crowd to be at last deposited with a final crush
into a little eddy close by some game of chance,
or booth where root beer and hot dogs are
sold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>They had been cast aside by the throng into
such an eddy as this when, finding herself without
other occupation, Mazie focused her opera
glasses, which hung by a strap at her side, on
a wooden tower two hundred feet high. This
tower, lighted as it was by ten thousand electric
lamps, seemed at the distance a white hot
obelisk of steel. The tower stood in the center
of the place and there were six bronze eagles
at the very top of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How plainly I can see them,&rdquo; Mazie murmured
to herself. &ldquo;I can even see the copper
wire that binds them to the pillars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little did she dream of the awe-inspiring and
awful sights she would witness on that tower,
with those glasses, on this very night.</p>
<p>It was at this moment that Pant noticed
little Tillie McFadden&rsquo;s eyes, full of longing,
fixed upon the roller coaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever ride on that?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The girl shook her head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Want to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re on!&rdquo; exclaimed Pant. &ldquo;When shall
we four meet again, and where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In just an hour,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;Meet us
beneath the statue of the two fools.&rdquo; This immense
statue, made of cement, stood near the
exit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;ll be there,&rdquo; smiled Pant.
&ldquo;Come on, Tillie. We&rsquo;ll do the city right,
roller coaster, City of Venice, ferris wheel and
all.&rdquo; Then they were swallowed up by the
crowd.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><br />CHAPTER XXII
<br />A STARTLING DISCOVERY</h2>
<p>As for Johnny and Mazie, they had visited
the park many times before. The amusements
were an old story, but the crowd was not. No
crowd is ever tiresome to a person who has a
keen mind and a true interest in the study of
his fellowman.</p>
<p>For these two it was enough to watch the
actions of these people&mdash;of this crowd in their
disguises. Many of them were dressed in
ridiculous costumes and nearly all were masked.
Thus, with their true natures for the time apparently
hidden by a mask, each person gave
himself over to the seeking of pleasure in the
way most natural to him. Many were truly
merry; some merely sordid, and a few were
brutal in their manner of extracting pleasure
from those about them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>As they drifted in and out among the
throngs, Johnny and Mazie were finally caught
in a narrow place and forced along against their
will.</p>
<p>When, at last, the throng broadened and
separated, they found themselves before another
table of chance. This time, instead of the
spindle wheel there was a board. In the lower
end of this board, which was perhaps two feet
wide by four long, there were eight holes. Beside
each of these holes were numbers. At the
top of the board were four balls. The balls
rested upon a narrow board. To play, one has
but to tip the narrow board and allow the
balls to roll to the bottom, where they settle
themselves in holes. One then adds up the
numbers before the balls and consults a table
of numbers before him. This table is composed
of red and black numbers. If the sum
reached by adding up chances to correspond to
a red number, the player wins a watch, a
camera, a silver cream pitcher or any other
article he may choose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Looks easy enough,&rdquo; smiled Johnny as he
watched the operator roll the balls. &ldquo;Too easy.
There&rsquo;s a trick somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Johnny got a lot of fun out of discovering
tricks. &ldquo;Mind if we watch him a little
while?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; answered Mazie, putting a hand
on his shoulder as the crowd pressed about
them. The man in the booth, a tall, broad
shouldered man, gave them a quick look.
Johnny blinked under that look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But after all,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re
masked. If he has seen us before he&rsquo;ll not
recognize us now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at the man and started. There
was something vaguely familiar about him.
Yet he, too, was heavily masked. There was
little chance of telling who he might be.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>For fifteen minutes Johnny studied the game.
Men played, women played and boys as well.
There were plenty of red numbers; but only
once in all that time, while the operator hauled
in the money, did red turn up. Yet, when for
a moment the business lulled, the man behind
the table could make red come up easily enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; said Johnny, scratching his
head. &ldquo;It seems so absurdly simple. One
would say it couldn&rsquo;t be doctored at all, and yet
it is. Ah well, what&rsquo;s the use? Let&rsquo;s go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was turning to go when a long arm
reached out from behind the board and touched
his shoulder. It was the operator. There was
greed shining from the small black eyes that
peeped evilly through the holes in the mask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, mister,&rdquo; the man was saying, &ldquo;I give
you a roll. It don&rsquo;t cost you noding. I don&rsquo;t
gives you noding. See! It is free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t want a roll,&rdquo; said Johnny,
starting away again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dot&rsquo;s fair enough, mister,&rdquo; replied the man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>This last remark went through the boy like
an electric shock. Those words, that accent,
the whole thing&mdash;where had he heard it before?
Strive as he might, rake down the walls
of his memory as he did, he could not recall.
And yet something within told him that he
should recall, that here was a key to something
important; something tremendously big.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he whispered to himself, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t recall
it now, but I can stick around. It may
come to me all of a flash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he thought to himself, &ldquo;if I
have to, I&rsquo;ll play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fortune favored him. He was not obliged
to play, but could watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Set &rsquo;em up!&rdquo; said a stranger, producing a
shiny quarter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Count &rsquo;em,&rdquo; he said a moment later as the
last ball dropped into its hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four, nine, sexteen, zwenty-zree. Dot&rsquo;s
black. Try again. Anoder times you are
lucky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man did try again, again and yet again,
and always he lost.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>And then, like a flash, the trick of the game
came to Johnny. If the balls were carefully
placed in certain definite positions on the narrow
board, they would always escape falling
into holes marked 7 and 11. These numbers
were needed if the result was to be a red
number.</p>
<p>As if by accident, he brushed the board with
his elbow. This moved a ball slightly to the
right.</p>
<p>The result was another black number. But
by a sudden movement the operator showed that
he was startled.</p>
<p>The stranger fed in two more quarters before
Johnny tried the trick again.</p>
<p>This time the operator looked at him and
uttered an audible snarl before he began to
count. He knew he was beaten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three, nine, fifteen, zwenty-zoo. Dot&rsquo;s
red,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>And at the sound of that low mutter Johnny
remembered.</p>
<p>So struck was he at this revelation, that he
could barely repress an audible exclamation.
The stranger chose a small pocket camera, and
the game went on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>From this time on the question of whether
the stranger won or lost did not count. Johnny
was trying to think; to plan a course of action.
He knew now where he had heard that man&rsquo;s
voice before&mdash;at the fire in which Mazie barely
missed losing her life.</p>
<p>As he looked at the man he knew he could
not be mistaken. The hooked nose was covered
by the mask, but the stoop was there and
the voice was the same. If he needed further
proof it was not long in coming. As the man
stepped back to take down the small camera,
Johnny noticed that he walked with a decided
limp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the man,&rdquo; Johnny thought to himself.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the man who burned the school houses,
the welfare center and the zoo, who attempted
to kill me, and did kill poor old Ben Zook!&rdquo;
As he thought of Ben Zook he found it difficult
to hold himself in hand. He wanted to
leap across the board and throttle the man
where he stood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;I must not.
I must be calm. I must remain here. I must
watch the play until I have thought what next
to do. One thing sure, I must not bungle my
chances now. Too much hinges on doing the
right thing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<h2 id="c23"><br />CHAPTER XXIII
<br />FOREST CITY&rsquo;S DOOM</h2>
<p>Johnny was up against the most puzzling
problem of his whole life. A tensely dramatic
situation, a novelist would have called it. Having
long since abandoned the theory that the
pink-eyed man was the firebug, he had fastened
upon the hook-nosed man as the real culprit.
With this in mind, he had connected past events
into an almost unbreakable chain of circumstances.
He had now but to find the man.
And here he was. He had found him. But
under what strange circumstances! What was
to be done? If he called upon the revellers to
assist him in apprehending the man they would
laugh merrily, thinking his request a joke. The
man, on the other hand, would not think it a
joke. He might choose either to vanish or to
put a bullet in Johnny&rsquo;s heart. That he would
do one or the other Johnny did not doubt, for
this man was a criminal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>One thing was in Johnny&rsquo;s favor; since he
was masked and there was nothing particularly
distinctive about him, it was not probable
that he had been recognized.</p>
<p>In vain he looked about him for a passing
policeman; in vain racked his brain for a way
out.</p>
<p>Then of a sudden there came the flash of a
suggestion. He would at least have a picture
of the man. Only a few days before he had
given a small camera to Tillie McFadden. In
his pocket was a film and some flash-light
powders he had meant to give her. The camera
the stranger had but this moment won was the
same size. The films would fit. The man,
though not playing now, was still in the crowd.
He would borrow or buy it.</p>
<p>Without at all knowing what it was about,
the stranger parted with his camera for a five
dollar bill, then went back to play.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>Johnny gave Mazie the camera, then pressed
the film into her hand as he whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Load the camera. Press my hand when
you&rsquo;re ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She knew about the flash-light powders and
appeared to understand, for she squeezed his
hand assuringly.</p>
<p>The stranger was again at the board. He
rolled again. By some freak of chance, this
time he won.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zwenty-four. Dot vins,&rdquo; said the faker.
&ldquo;Vot do you choose?&rdquo; His voice held a note
of irritation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you suggest?&rdquo; the stranger
asked, turning to Johnny.</p>
<p>It was with the greatest of difficulty that
Johnny focussed his mind on this simple task
which at other times and under different circumstances
would have been a pleasure.</p>
<p>Then a sudden inspiration came to him. At
the far corner, and on the top shelf, was a
silver pitcher. If the stranger asked for that
the man&rsquo;s back, while he was taking it down,
would be turned long enough for Johnny to
prepare a flash.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d take that pitcher,&rdquo; he said steadily, at
the same time pointing to the pitcher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; he whispered to Mazie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready,&rdquo; she answered back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he turns,&rdquo; he whispered. There followed
ten seconds of suspense which was ended
by a loud pop and a blinding flash of light.</p>
<p>The silver pitcher fell with a thump at
Johnny&rsquo;s feet. The astonishment and rage of
the man conducting the game was a thing to
marvel at. His face went white, then purple.
As if to snatch the camera away, he leaped
at Mazie. She forced her way back into the
crowd. Then, just as it seemed that matters
were at their worst, there came a wild cry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;FIRE! FIRE! FIRE!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a second Johnny believed that someone
had been unduly frightened by his flash and
was spreading a false alarm. One glance toward
the far end of the park told him the
terrible truth. A building at that end, a sort
of office, was all ablaze. He had long felt
that the place was doomed, and doomed it was!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And on such a night, with such a throng!&rdquo;
he murmured.</p>
<p>The fire held his eye but a second. The man&mdash;he
must get that man! He was gone&mdash;no,
there he was. He was racing before the fear-mad
mob that threatened to run him down. In
a twinkling Johnny was on his trail.</p>
<p>He had not followed him twenty paces when,
to his astonishment, he saw the man turn and
dart through the only door of the great wooden
tower which loomed two hundred feet in air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he&rsquo;s trapped!&rdquo; Johnny panted. &ldquo;He
trapped himself. I wonder why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who could tell? Had a mad fear of the mob
driven him into that place as the hounds drive
a deer over the precipice? Had he hoped to
slip safely out a little later?</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, there was little chance
of escape. With but one thought in his mind,
Johnny Thompson was close behind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>By a single flash of his electric torch Johnny
located the man some twenty steps up a rickety
winding staircase that led to the very top of
the tower. The next second, with his torch off,
in utter darkness, Johnny put his foot on the
lower step. A roaring furnace of fire was not
far behind him; a dangerous man before him;
but come what might, he was prepared to do
his whole duty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><br />CHAPTER XXIV
<br />FERRIS WHEEL AND FIRE</h2>
<p>Forest City was on fire. The wind was directly
behind the blaze. Before it, beckoning
it on, were tons of confetti, board walks, dry
as tinder, and flimsy structures of stucco and
lath. Nothing could save this play place of
the frightened thousands.</p>
<p>Realizing this, and fearing death from the
blaze, the throngs that but a moment before
were screaming with merriment now raced
screaming and shouting with fear toward the
back of the park where there were no exits,
but where flimsy board fences would offer little
resistance to their mad onrush.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>To add to the terror of the moment, the
powerhouse was at once attacked by the unhindered
blaze. The cables were burned.
Every chain, every cable, every wheel of the
place suddenly stopped. The moving platform
which bore the gondolas of the City of Venice
majestically on their way, came to a sudden
halt. The men, women and children who
crowded the gondolas were obliged to leap into
the water and to battle their way as best they
could through the maze of plaster-of-paris castles,
humble homes and shops toward the faint
spot of light which marked the exit. This spot
of light was but the glare of the fire, for all
lights had burned out with the cable.</p>
<p>Only the glare of burning buildings lighted
the awe inspiring scene that followed. The
roller coaster, pausing with a sudden jerk in
its mad rush, left some merrymakers stranded
on light trestles, and others so tilted on a down
glide that they were standing more on their
heads than their feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>There came the screams of women who had
lost their way in some strange place of entertainment
and mirth. In this throng were
women in thin ball-room costumes; boys and
girls with roller skates clanking on their feet;
performers from the outdoor stage, dressed in
little more than tinsel and tights, and all pushing
and shoving, screaming and praying that they
might reach the far end and break away into
wider spaces beyond before the fire was upon
them.</p>
<p>And the fire. Having started in the offices,
it has leaped joyfully on to the power-house and
thence to the Palace of Fools. The faces on
the statue of two fools are seized with a sudden
pallor. They become yellow and jaundiced,
then turn suddenly black. Then of a sudden
they assume a very ruddy hue. As quickly
after that they crumble to nothing and fall, a
mass of dust. Johnny and Mazie will not meet
Pant and little Tillie McFadden beneath the
statue of two fools to-night. No, nor on any
other night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>And what had happened to Pant and Tillie
McFadden? Up to the last few terrible moments
they had been having the time of their
young lives. Up and down, under and over,
they had rushed through space on the roller
coaster. With all the solemn majesty of a trip
to Europe they had ridden through the City
of Venice. For a time they had wandered
upon the board-walk. It was during this walk
that Pant had caught sight of a familiar figure,
a slim girl with a red rose pinned on her breast.
He had watched her for but a moment when
he was made sure by her skipping step, which
was more a dance than a walk, that she was
the dancing girl who had saved his life that
night in the den of the underworld. Just as
he had been about to put his hand on her
shoulder, a screeching mob of revelers had
come swooping down upon her and, as a torrent
of water bears away a leaf, had carried her
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah well,&rdquo; he had sighed, &ldquo;I will come upon
her again.&rdquo; At that he had turned to Tillie
McFadden, who was standing staring at the
Ferris wheel with the fascination of a child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to go on there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had waited their turn, had gotten
aboard and had gone up over and down, up
over and down again, and were starting on
their third round when the cry: &ldquo;FIRE!
FIRE! FIRE!&rdquo; high pitched and shrill,
sounded above the shouts and screams of the
revelers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit right where you are,&rdquo; said Pant reassuringly,
as the little girl, frightened by the cries
and the sight of leaping flames, started from
her seat. &ldquo;The fire is a full block away from
us. Long before it reaches us we will have
reached the ground, leaped from this cage and
scampered away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>The wheel turned about at a snail-like pace,
stopping and starting, stopping and starting
again. As they mounted higher and higher,
the flames, led on by great masses of confetti
which acted like a fuse, leaped from building
to building, coming ever nearer, nearer, nearer!
Pant became truly alarmed. At last they
reached the very highest point and here the
great wheel came to a sudden stop. Pant knew,
from the nature of the stop, that here they
would stay, and his consternation was complete.
There they were, swinging in the air a hundred
feet from the ground, with a raging conflagration
racing madly toward them and with
only steel rods and bars between them and the
ground.</p>
<p class="tb">Johnny Thompson was at that moment in a
scarcely less perilous position. Having followed
the firebug a distance of fifty feet up that
rickety stairway, he had paused to flash on his
light, only to discover to his intense horror that
the man, crouching on a small landing not
ten feet above him, was engaged in aiming a
knife with a ten-inch blade directly at his head.</p>
<p>Had he not been Johnny Thompson, he
would have perished on the spot. Trained for
every emergency, he leaped clean of the stairs,
but holding firmly to the rail of the bannister.
The next instant the knife went clanging
against the wall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>For a moment, in utter darkness, the boy
clung there. Then, hearing the man he hunted
again begin the ascent, he swung back upon the
stairs and followed.</p>
<p>In that moment he allowed himself a few
darting thoughts as to how the affair would
end. His purpose was to get that man! True
enough; but how? This he could not answer,
nor could he resist the desire to follow. So
follow he did, step by step, circle by circle, up,
up, up, to dizzy heights. The tower had no
windows. He could not see the fire, nor could
he realize by what leaps and bounds it was
fighting its way toward that very tower.</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;Tillie,&rdquo; said Pant as he saw that the Ferris
wheel had made its final stop and had left them
high in air, &ldquo;I am by nature a cat. I have
lived in the jungles with great cats. There is
one thing a cat can do supremely well&mdash;climb.
I can climb. I can go down those rods and
take you with me if you can but cling to my
back. Can you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>For answer, the girl leaped upon his back
to cling there with such tenacity that her nails
cut his flesh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the girl!&rdquo; he smiled approvingly.</p>
<p>Cautiously he lowered himself over the edge
of the car to grasp a bar of iron. It was at
this instant that he heard a shriek from the
car to the right. Turning about, he saw a
slender girl dressed as a Gypsy, clinging to the
side of her car with one hand while with the
other she appealed to him for aid. She had
torn the mask from her face. He recognized
her at a glance&mdash;the girl who had saved his
life in the den of the underworld.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;afraid of great
heights, but not afraid to leap upon the arm
of a villain with a knife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay where you are,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be
back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>Rash promise. To catch at a rod here, at
a bar there, to swing from bar to bar as an ape
swings from branch to branch, going down,
down to safety; all this was hard enough, but
to ascend, with the fierce glare of the fire
upon you&mdash;that would be next to impossible!
Yet he had promised. He owed his life to
that girl and he must fulfill his promise.</p>
<p>As he reached the hub of the wheel he could
feel his strength waning. If he covered the
remaining distance to the ground he could never
return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tillie,&rdquo; he said soberly, &ldquo;there is a bar
going directly to the ground. Do you think
you could grip it hard enough to slide down
it without falling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s face went white. One glance at
the pitiful creature above her, and courage
returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next second her arms encircled the bar.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p class="tb">Following on the heels of his man, a hundred
and fifty feet in air, Johnny came at last
to an open balcony above which a great cupola
reared itself to the sky. In his mad fear the
firebug had already begun mounting the stair
in the cupola. As for Johnny, he paused to
consider. It was well that he should.</p>
<p>As he looked down a sudden shudder shook
his form like a chill. The fire, leaping across
a roof more than a hundred feet below him,
was already licking at the wooden foundation
of the very tower on which he stood. Even in
a vain attempt to retrace his steps, a whiff of
smoke borne up from below told him that in
a brief space of time the tower would be a
roaring chimney of flames. What was to be
done? Leaving the unfortunate culprit in the
cupola to his well deserved fate, whatever it
might be, he turned his every thought to ways
of escape. There appeared but one, and that
all but impossible. But there was no choice.
Sitting calmly down, he pulled off his shoes,
then climbing over the railing, disappeared at
a point directly above one corner of the tower.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<p class="tb">While Tillie McFadden, with no further harm
than a few scratches and bruises, was making
her way to the ground, Pant was performing
what seemed a mad feat. He was battling his
way upward on the wheel. Here he gripped
a rod to swing outward and upward, there
climbed straight up where a real cat must have
failed, and then, leaping quite free from any
support, flew through the air to grip a rod ten
feet away.</p>
<p>Up, up, up he climbed until, utterly exhausted,
he dropped in the box occupied by
the girl.</p>
<p>For ten seconds he lay there panting. The
fire, roaring like a volcano, sent flames two
hundred feet in air, scorching their cheeks and
showering them with sparks. In a moment
Pant was himself again.</p>
<p>Snatching the girl&rsquo;s cape from her, he consigned
it to the flames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your arms about my neck, your feet about
my waist,&rdquo; he ordered, &ldquo;and down we go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<p>He was instantly obeyed, and down indeed
they went. Though that girl may live two
lifetimes, never again will she experience a ride
like that. With the breath of the fire beating
upon them, they swung from rod to rod, shot
through space, glided and slid until with a final
terrible bump, they came to solid earth and
went racing away after the fast disappearing
throng.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</div>
<h2 id="c25"><br />CHAPTER XXV
<br />THE HUMAN SPIDER</h2>
<p>Strangely enough, as Johnny crept over the
railing that hung out over one hundred and fifty
feet of empty air, he chanced to think of the
black bag beneath the bed in his room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a numbskull I was to throw it there
and not tell anyone about it,&rdquo; he thought to
himself. &ldquo;I shall probably not get out of this
alive. The bag may stay there for weeks. Then
it is likely to be found by the wrong person.
And I am all but certain that it contains evidence
which would go far toward putting Knobs
Whittaker behind the bars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During all this time his friend Mazie, ignorant
of the fate of her three friends, had at
first been jostled and pushed by the fear-maddened
throng until at last she had fought her
way out into a little open space where she was
allowed to pause for breath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">[256]</div>
<p>Stationing herself in a secluded spot, she had
watched the little drama played by Pant and
his two friends. Without knowing who they
were, she had screamed her approval with the
others.</p>
<p>Having caught sight of two figures moving
about at the top of the tower, and happening to
think of her opera glasses, she drew them from
her pocket and focussed them upon the top of
the tower.</p>
<p>A look of surprise spread over her face as
she recognized the topmost man. It was the
hook-nosed, stooped figure of the firebug. The
glasses dropped from her nerveless fingers as
she recognized the other one as her friend
Johnny, who was at this moment crawling over
the railing with the apparent intention of leaping
to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be killed!&rdquo; she fairly screamed as she
closed her eyes to shut out the sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">[257]</div>
<p>When at last she summoned up enough courage
to look again she was astonished to see,
some twenty feet below the balcony where she
had last seen Johnny, a figure that clung to
the corner of the tower and appeared by some
miracle of skill and strength to be moving
downward.</p>
<p>She snatched up her glasses to look again and
again came little short of dropping them the
second time. The figure clinging to the corner
of the tower was Johnny!</p>
<p>Seldom is it given to man to witness such a
human spider act as she was privileged to
watch during the next five minutes. The
chance that Johnny had seen was a slim one,
yet it was a chance. At regular intervals of
a foot, two double rows of incandescent lamps
ran down the corner of the tower. The two
rows on the south side were four inches apart;
those on the east the same. These lamp sockets
protruded for about three inches, and using
them as steps to his ladder, Johnny was slowly
but surely climbing downward. There was
great peril in the undertaking. A broken socket,
a sudden slip, and all would be over. Never in
all his eventful life had Johnny undertaken a
feat which required so much skill and daring.
Yet, once he had committed himself to the undertaking,
there was no turning back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">[258]</div>
<p>By great good fortune, the sockets which held
the lamps had been fastened with long nails instead
of screws. The wood was strong. One
by one the sockets supported his weight. Like
a bat, gripping with both hands and feet, he
moved cautiously downward. As Mazie watched
him she measured the distance:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A quarter done, a third, a half, a&mdash;but
there,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a flame shooting out
below him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny saw it, too, but there was no turning
back. Trusting to good fortune, he continued
steadily downward. Fortune did not desert him;
a breath of air sucked the flame back and the
next moment he had passed the spot.</p>
<p>Again Mazie resumed her eye measurement.
It was a mad thing to do, but it was all that
was left to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">[259]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Two-thirds of the way; three-quarters. But
there&rsquo;s a lower balcony! How is he to pass
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>How indeed? This balcony, some six feet in
width, left no opportunity to climb over its rail
and down. Some forty feet from the ground,
it threatened to stop the boy&rsquo;s progress and
condemn him to a terrible death.</p>
<p>As Johnny reached this balcony, flames were
leaping at him from every side. Directly before
him, however, was a clear space. Through
that space he caught sight of what at first appeared
to be flames, but what proved in the end
to be but the reflection of the fire in the pool
of water used by the chute. It was fully forty
feet below him.</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s keen brain worked like lightning.
One look, and then a racing leap. With arms
and figure set for a dive, he shot far out and
down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">[260]</div>
<p>He disappeared from Mazie&rsquo;s view, nor could
she ascertain his fate. To go there to see would
have been sheer madness. Half burned off at
the bottom, the two hundred foot tower was
already tottering to a fall.</p>
<p>A moment it hung there in space, a second,
and yet a third. Having once more trained her
glass on the top of it, Mazie saw a figure standing
upon the topmost pinnacle. It was the firebug!
For twenty seconds he hovered there between
earth and sky. Then, just as the tower
bent to a rakish angle, he toppled over and fell
headlong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as well,&rdquo; she sighed, dropping her
glasses and brushing a tear from her eye.
&ldquo;There can be no pain in such a death. Poor
fellow! His brain must have been addled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time she stood there alone, thinking
of many things. Then, realizing that the hour
was late and that there was little chance of
finding her friends even if they were still alive,
she turned her face toward home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they are still in the land of the living,&rdquo;
she told herself, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll come straggling in.
A cup of hot cocoa will do them good. I&rsquo;ll
have the water ready.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">[261]</div>
<h2 id="c26"><br />CHAPTER XXVI
<br />SAFE AT HOME</h2>
<p>In the meantime alarms had gone in. At
the central fire station the third alarm came in
before the megaphone had repeated the second.
Clanging and screeching, forcing their way
down streets swarming with people, the firefighters
came. These ranged themselves along
the outer walls of that famous place of play
and mirth. No attempt was made to save
Forest City. It was useless. The home of
riotous joy was doomed. All the firemen could
hope to do was to beat back the flames and
prevent them from spreading to other parts of
the city.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">[262]</div>
<p>Long after the last structure of the vanished
&ldquo;City&rdquo; had gone crashing down and the great
throngs had crept away to their homes, a solitary
figure stood in a dark recess between two
buildings, watching the heaps of red ruin and
desolation.</p>
<p>A short, sturdy fellow, he stood there hatless,
and as the heat from the fire played upon
his clothes they appeared to smoke, but it was
only steam.</p>
<p>His keen eyes, for the most part watching the
center of the fire swept area, now and again
went roving up and down the outer lines as if
searching for someone.</p>
<p>And then, as if fire were not enough, from
the sky there came a sudden deluge of rain.
One of those sudden torrents that come sweeping
up from the lake in summer, it passed as
quickly as it came, but in its wake it left black,
smouldering desolation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">[263]</div>
<p>The hatless figure had moved to a place of
shelter, but as the storm passed he came out
again and stood staring at the ruins. As he
stood there a shudder shook his frame. It was
indeed a thing to shudder at. Two hours before,
twenty thousand joyous mortals had rioted
there, and now only charcoal and ashes marked
its place, while above it all there loomed a
blackened and twisted spectre which had once
been the Ferris wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it was doomed,&rdquo; he murmured at
last, &ldquo;knew it days ago. If only I had got
him in time! But now, please God, it is over.
There will be no others of this kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that he turned and walked rapidly away.</p>
<p class="tb">Tillie McFadden was the first to arrive at
Mazie&rsquo;s home; indeed, she arrived before Mazie.
Mazie found her curled up on a couch in the
corner, fast asleep. Her hands were scratched
and bruised, there were tear stains on her
cheeks, but for all this she slept the peaceful
sleep of a child.</p>
<p>Mazie felt an almost uncontrollable desire
to waken her, to ask her what had befallen her,
what she had seen of the fire, and what had
become of Pant. She conquered this desire, to
murmur as she spread a blanket over the sleeping
girl:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">[264]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. Why waken her to the horror of it
all? A long sleep, and she will have forgotten
it. Oh, to be a little child again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that she sat down to anxiously await news
from her comrades.</p>
<p>In half an hour Pant arrived. As Mazie
opened the door he came slouching in without
so much as looking at her. That was Pant&rsquo;s
way. But to-night he moved as one in a trance,
or perhaps like one who had travelled so far
against the wind in a snowstorm that his senses
had become so benumbed that he no longer
thinks clearly.</p>
<p>It was not a cold night, but Mazie had kindled
a little fire in the grate. Without speaking,
Pant found a seat by that fire. At once he
appeared to fall into a doze.</p>
<p>When the girl touched his arm to offer him
a steaming drink he started as from a dream.</p>
<p>After he had gulped down the drink he appeared
more alive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">[265]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I carried her down,&rdquo; he grumbled, half to
himself. &ldquo;Gar! That was hard! We landed
on the ground. Then we ran for it, and in the
crowd I lost her. Do you think I will see her
again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See who?&rdquo; asked Mazie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Gypsy girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you know? But of course you
wouldn&rsquo;t. She&mdash;she&rsquo;s the one who saved my
life and I&mdash;I carried her off the Ferris wheel.
She would have burned. The car burned before
we touched the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Mazie. &ldquo;Then you were
the one who performed that marvelous feat on
the wheel? I might have known. No one else
could have done that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;saw us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But tell me about that other time, the
time the girl saved your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pant told her the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;ll ever see her again?&rdquo; he
asked eagerly as he finished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">[266]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; said Mazie slowly, &ldquo;you
never know. It&rsquo;s a strange world we live in.
There are a hundred million of people and more,
in our land. How many do you know? A few.
There are eight miles of homes between our
house and the heart of the city. Walk the
whole distance, eight miles, twelve blocks to the
mile, twenty homes to the block, probably two
thousand homes. Ten thousand people live in
those homes. How many of them do you know?
None, perhaps. We live in little worlds of our
own. Our little worlds are like ships at sea.
We meet and pass others, like ships that pass
in the night. You deserted your little world for
a night and entered the Gypsy girl&rsquo;s world.
She left hers for a night and entered yours.
Now she&rsquo;s gone back to hers and you to yours.
Will you meet again? Why should you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure enough, why should we?&rdquo; echoed
Pant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone at the door!&rdquo; exclaimed Pant.</p>
<p>Mazie was so overjoyed at sight of the one
she found at the door that it was with difficulty
that she refrained from throwing her
arms about his neck. It was Johnny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">[267]</div>
<p>His story was soon told. His dive from the
lower balcony of the tower had been successful.
Having landed in the water without so much as
being stunned, he had done the Australian crawl
to the far end of the pool where was a landing.
There he had leaped to his feet and gone racing
away. Scarcely a moment had elapsed after
he reached a point of safety, when the tower
came crashing down on the very spot where
he had stood.</p>
<p>Having seen the leap of the man he had
followed into the tower, he had watched to see
if by any miracle of circumstance he might
have landed in the pool and followed him to
safety. Since this did not seem humanly possible,
he had given the man up for lost, but had
lingered about the scene until the torrent had
reduced the fire to charcoal. Then he had come
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here we all are, safe and well,&rdquo; smiled
Mazie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the firebug is dead,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; Pant challenged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">[268]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I watched the burning pile until it was done.
I tell you he was killed by the fall, crushed by
the building that came crashing down upon him.
He should be dead enough from all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how do you know he was the firebug?&rdquo;
persisted Pant. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t really prove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can,&rdquo; said Johnny positively, &ldquo;and to-morrow
I will.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">[269]</div>
<h2 id="c27"><br />CHAPTER XXVII
<br />THE CONTENTS OF THE BLACK BAG</h2>
<p>Johnny found the fire chief in a sour mood
next morning. Two disastrous fires in a single
night, both probable cases of arson. One had
been tipped off to him beforehand and he had
sent Johnny and some of his best men to watch.
Yet they had found nothing. It was enough
to break the staunchest heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buck up, Chief,&rdquo; smiled Johnny, &ldquo;the firebug&rsquo;s
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is, is he!&rdquo; roared the Chief. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t
I see him not two hours ago? Ain&rsquo;t he goin&rsquo;
to get out of jail unless we can pin something
definite on him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Johnny&rsquo;s turn to lose heart. The firebug
in jail, about to escape for lack of a charge?
What did this mean?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">[270]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where&mdash;where did you catch him?&rdquo; he
stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you expect? By the fire he set,
to be sure; the Randolph Street fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Johnny breathed more easily. &ldquo;You
got Knobs Whittaker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;d you think? Wasn&rsquo;t he the man I
set you to watch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why yes&mdash;one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And didn&rsquo;t we catch him wandering round
in the crowd, big as life and staring round as if
he was looking for somebody he&rsquo;d lost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he describe the man he was looking
for?&rdquo; Johnny smiled as he asked this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, why should he? Why should we
care?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably you shouldn&rsquo;t. Only I thought it
might be me he was looking for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You? Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a bit of property of his.&rdquo; At this
Johnny held up the black bag that he had taken
from Knobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you get that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">[271]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; said Johnny, calmly sitting
down.</p>
<p>He did tell, and after the Chief had listened
with all his ears he exclaimed at the finish:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open it up. You&rsquo;re right, it may contain
some evidence and evidence is what we need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Johnny,&rdquo; he said as the boy
struggled to break the lock, &ldquo;that was the hottest
fire I ever experienced. There were enough
chemicals in that lower story to charge a volcano.
It&rsquo;s a wonder there wasn&rsquo;t an explosion.
Those boys will forfeit their insurance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might have a little evidence on that point,
too,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;You remember my telling
of the truck that unloaded there just before the
fire? Well, that may have been a plant. Perhaps
the company had not ordered those chemicals.
Knobs Whittaker may have had them
put there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did the diamond company&rsquo;s property
fare?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">[272]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Total loss. Never saw anything to equal it.
Safe just over the chemicals. Dropped right
into the mess of those flaming chemicals. The
safe was melted to a solid mass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the diamonds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diamonds? In the safe, I guess. Or maybe
they melted, too. Diamonds are carbon you
know, same as coal. Wouldn&rsquo;t expect them to
withstand the heat, would you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if they were there,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;I
thought it might be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment the lock to the black bag
gave way. Johnny threw up the cover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shade my eyes!&rdquo; exclaimed the Chief.
&ldquo;What have we here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like diamonds to me,&rdquo; said Johnny
with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they are!&rdquo; exclaimed the Chief, seizing
a small case and examining its contents
closely. &ldquo;And that was the game. Knobs was
in with the diamond merchant! Man! What
a haul they would have made!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next instant he dashed to the telephone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">[273]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That you, Cassidy?&rdquo; he said a moment
later. &ldquo;The Fire Chief speaking. Hold Knobs
without bail. We&rsquo;ve got the goods on him. A
dead open and shut case. He&rsquo;ll do twenty years
for last night&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said to Johnny after resuming his
usual composed manner, &ldquo;what was this you
were telling me about the firebug being dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was something else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one who set fire to Forest City, and all
those other places of public pleasure, the enemy
of happiness. Do you remember the tall stooped
man with a hook-nose and a limp that I spoke
to you about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you prove it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">[274]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you can you&rsquo;re mighty well off.
You&rsquo;re well off as it is. I&rsquo;ll make the insurance
companies come through with a fat reward on
this,&rdquo; he patted the black bag. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s
a reward offered by the city for the firebug. If
you can prove that his work is over you&rsquo;ll be
doing yourself a service as well as every law-abiding
citizen of this old town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it before dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to it, Johnny. More power to your good
right arm.&rdquo; The Chief grasped his hand in a
hearty grip, then escorted him to the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">[275]</div>
<h2 id="c28"><br />CHAPTER XXVIII
<br />THE FIREBUG&rsquo;S SECRET REVEALED</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; said Pant, as their train sped
along, &ldquo;what did Knobs Whittaker have to do
with that string of fires&mdash;the schools, the Zoo,
and Forest City?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing, I guess. It was that man with
the hooked nose who set them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t proved that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we are now on our way out to
the black shack by the edge of the swamp. I
think we&rsquo;ll find some proof out there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were on the train speeding southward
toward the marsh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Knobs wasn&rsquo;t in with old hook-nose, why
were they together in that dive where I came
near getting bumped off?&rdquo; asked Pant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">[276]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Doubtless they were acquainted. Men of
the same trade, even if it&rsquo;s of a criminal nature,
usually are. Birds of a feather, you know. It
may be, too, that Knobs was encouraging this
other man. If the fires set by him could keep
the eyes of the police and inspectors off Knobs,
then he would have easy going.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His big game, though, was the diamond
shop. It looked easy. To plant all those chemicals
beneath his safe, to set a fire, then beat
it with the diamonds, leaving everyone to believe
they were lost, seemed simple enough. It
would have been, too, if it hadn&rsquo;t been my luck
to hit him behind the ear. Got that picture?&rdquo;
he asked suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pant took a small snapshot from his pocket
and handed it to Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty good, even if it was taken under
difficult circumstances,&rdquo; he said, holding it up
to the light.</p>
<p>It was a picture of a large man wearing a
mask and holding a silver cream pitcher in his
hand. It was the picture he and Mazie had
taken at the booth just before the fire started.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">[277]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mask sort of spoils it, but I think they&rsquo;ll
recognize that stoop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people who have seen him before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time they rode in silence. Then Johnny
spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there is any reward for all this work,
Tillie McFadden gets half of it. She gave me
the first good hunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the hunch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That the man who set the fires wasn&rsquo;t in
the building when they were set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You expect to prove that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a mechanism?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No other mechanism than you&rsquo;ll find in any
building of consequence. Here we are!&rdquo; he exclaimed
suddenly.</p>
<p>They were at the station near the marsh.</p>
<p>A half hour later found them creeping on
hands and knees, making their way from sand
dune to sand dune. In his hand Johnny gripped
the black automatic he had taken from Knobs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">[278]</div>
<p>&ldquo;One more dune,&rdquo; he breathed, &ldquo;then we&rsquo;ll
have to make a break for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he rose to creep forward again he caught
sight of the roof of the black shack.</p>
<p>The next moment, somewhat excited and
breathless, they were dashing for the shack.</p>
<p>Once within the shadow of its side they
paused to calm their wildly beating hearts.
Then gripping his automatic hard, Johnny
popped his head up before the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he grunted a second later. &ldquo;I
thought it might be that way. Not a soul here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lock on the door was a simple one and
they were soon inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the hook-nosed one&rsquo;s shack all right,&rdquo;
said Johnny. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen him wear this long
rain-coat.&rdquo; He took the coat from its hook.
&ldquo;Bring it along as evidence. And these.&rdquo; He
walked to the corner where were four black
cylinders standing on end. They were what
remained of the pile he had seen there some
time before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">[279]</div>
<p>Handling them with great care, as if afraid
they might explode, he first wrapped them in a
piece of paper he had taken from his pocket,
then buckled a strap tightly about them.</p>
<p>For a moment he stood looking about the
cabin. Then turning toward the door, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on. I think we have all that is of any
value to us here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once back on the beach, they did not return
directly to the station, but paused first to interview
some fishermen who were mending their
nets, and then later to knock at a cabin farther
down the beach.</p>
<p>At the cabin a woman said that a man resembling
the one in the snapshot had sometimes
come to her house for milk. The fishermen
were even more positive in their identification.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes sir,&rdquo; said one of them, &ldquo;that was his
shack out there by the marsh. I&rsquo;ve often seen
him. But what&rsquo;s the mask for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carnival,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">[280]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So you think it was old Hook-nose who shot
at you and went hunting you and Mazie out
here on the marsh?&rdquo; said Pant as they
walked on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure of it. And I&rsquo;m equally sure that
he killed poor old Ben Zook. The last evidence
against him will be put to the test this afternoon
in the Fire Chief&rsquo;s office at three. Will
you be there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>True to his promise, Pant was there at the
appointed hour. So were Mazie and the Fire
Chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Johnny, as if about to perform
some scientific experiment, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask you to examine
this scrap of black cardboard which Ben
Zook and I found on his island after the mysterious
blaze out there. Compare it with the
outer covering of the four cylinders I have here.
Same material, isn&rsquo;t it, Chief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say it was the same.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">[281]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;take a look at this
telephone which I took from the burning Zoo.
As you will see, it is equipped with two pairs
of wires. The ends of the smaller wires are
scorched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind, Chief, I&rsquo;ll just disconnect
these wires and hook them up with your
own phone.&rdquo; He unstrapped the tubes and,
selecting one, set the others some distance away.
&ldquo;Now I will connect the other ends by means
of the screw contact points which you will see
already conveniently placed at the top of this
black tube.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he smiled, as he stepped back quickly
as if expecting something sudden, &ldquo;if you will
be kind enough to take down your receiver and
ask the operator to give you a ring?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a second the Chief hesitated, then complied
with his request. At the same time Mazie
crowded herself into the most remote corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Operator,&rdquo; called the Chief, &ldquo;give us a
ring, will you?&rdquo; His hand trembled slightly
as he hung up the receiver. In the room, for
the space of seconds, all was silence, a silence so
complete that the buzzing of a fly far up on
the ceiling sounded distinctly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">[282]</div>
<p>Then came the jangle of the bell. Instantly,
as if by magic, the black tube split straight
down the middle into two perfect halves, toppled
over, revealing a fan-shaped mass of tissue
paper which promptly burst into flame. So
suddenly did it all happen that had not Johnny
seen to it that there was a chemical fire extinguisher
right at hand, the Chief might have
found himself in the embarrassing position of
being obliged to turn in a fire alarm from his
own office.</p>
<p>As it was, the fire was soon out. After that
Johnny&rsquo;s three friends sat staring at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The explanation is simple enough,&rdquo; he
smiled. &ldquo;In the case of every fire set by this
misguided man&mdash;who was a crank and perhaps
a radical as well&mdash;he pretended to be a
telephone wireman. Having in this way gotten
inside, always just at closing time, he connected
his wires with the phone, then planted a fire trap
such as this in some store-room where there
was plenty of combustibles. After making sure
that he was the last one out, he left the building.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since everyone associated with the office
knew that everyone in the office left at a definite
hour, there were no phone calls after the trap
had been set.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At his appointed hour, ten, eleven, or twelve
o&rsquo;clock at night, the firebug, by this time perhaps
ten miles away, would go to some phone
and calmly call the number.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Bam! The telephone rings; a spark
traveling down one of those fine wires, loosens
a spring that throws the trap open, tissue paper
unfolds like a fan, a taper is lighted that fires
the trap, and all is prepared for the fire alarm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pity that so much ingenuity should
be used for so dire a purpose,&rdquo; said the Chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you think this firebug is dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it. I have a report to that effect,
and plenty of proof that he was the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall have the reward. You deserve
it.&rdquo; The Chief turned to grasp his hand.</p>

<p>It would probably not have seemed strange
if Johnny Thompson, after such strenuous experiences
as these, should have decided to take
a long rest. So he did decide, but fate ruled
differently. By chance, on that very night, he
walked into the shop of an old man who was a
wizard at working in wood&mdash;ebony, mahogany,
teak and rosewood. He showed Johnny some
marvels and in the end told him a tale that set
Johnny&rsquo;s blood racing fast.</p>
<p>It was this tale that led the boy off on a most
thrilling adventure, which you will find recorded
in our next book, &ldquo;The Red Lure.&rdquo;</p>
